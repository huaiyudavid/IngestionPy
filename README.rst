This package is developed to extract, ingest and index academic documents 
into a digital library database and a Solr Index. It was initially designed
for improving the original ingestion pipeline of the CiteSeerX project by 
removing time gaps between extraction and ingestion, and between ingestion
and indexing. The authors are Dr. Jian Wu and Huaiyu Yang.
