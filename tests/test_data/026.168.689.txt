CHAPTER 1 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
This report has been prepared under a project initiative by the Federal Highway 
Administration (FHWA) to identify the ‘state-of-the-practice’ for traffic control strategies 
at toll plazas, and to develop recommended guidelines for agencies and departments that 
operate or plan to design and build such facilities.  
 
The report contents begin with this introductory chapter.  This chapter includes sections 
that outlines the purpose of this Project, provides a problem statement, articulating the 
focus of the project efforts, lists the study objectives, describes the methodology used to 
achieve the objectives, and concludes with the intended use of this report.    
 
The introduction is followed by four chapters that include the state-of-the-practice and 
recommended guidelines for the following technical areas encompassing the development 
of traffic control strategies at toll plazas: ‘Plaza Operations/Lane Configuration’, ‘Signing, 
Markings and Channelization’, ‘Geometric and Safety Design’, and ‘Toll Collection 
Equipment Technology’.  The aggregation of these chapters provides useful historical 
information and a comprehensive analysis of when and where to apply various traffic 
control strategies.   
 
The final chapter concludes this Report by identifying further research needs, which 
require more rigorous study including field verification of performance. This chapter also 
lists all of the recommended guidelines presented in the preceding chapters.  A glossary of 
terms, definitions and diagrams to assist the reader’s understanding of the topic material 
follows along with Appendix A Summary of Survey Results, Appendix B Expert Panel 
Workshop Summary, and Appendix C Literature Search. 
 
1.1 PURPOSE 
 
The purpose and focus of this report is to develop guidelines for designing and 
implementing traffic control strategies and devices at toll plazas that, for example, inform 
drivers which lanes to use for specific methods of payment, reduce speed variance,  
discourage lane changing and properly install equipment and devices.  This was 
accomplished after researching related studies and reports, surveying current practices, and 
learning from the experience of experts within the toll collection industry.  The goal is to 
achieve a consistent strategy for handling potential points of conflict, controlling flow of 
various vehicle types and conveying information at toll plazas so that safety and operations 
are enhanced, better efficiency and economy of design are achieved, and motorist 
recognition and comprehension are improved.  This must be accomplished in 
consideration of the fact that each toll facility may desire its own unique identity.

State of the Practice and Recommendations 
on Traffic Control Strategies at Toll Plazas 
This report addresses toll plazas built on mainline highway sections, access ramps, and 
approaches to bridges and tunnels. Different types of toll collection processes are 
addressed, including: automated cash/card/ticket, manual cash/card/ticket, and electronic 
toll collection (ETC).  While this report covers plazas on roadway mainlines, interchange 
and access ramps, and approaches to bridges, and tunnels, the scope of the survey 
contained in Appendix A is limited to mainline plazas and approaches to bridges and 
tunnels.  Therefore, design considerations and elements unique to ramp plazas may not be 
addressed in this report.  
 
1.2 PROBLEM STATEMENT 
 
Many decision points exist while approaching the plaza, at the plaza, and on departure from 
the plaza.  The decision points can lead to vehicle merging, weaving, queuing, diverging and 
differential speeds.  Diverging and weaving occurs on the approach to the plaza as 
electronic toll collection (ETC) users separate from cash paying customers, who then 
further diverge based on selected cash payment lane type, shortest traffic queue, and lane 
status (i.e., open or closed).  Multiple collection methods can increase the potential for side 
swipe and rear-end collisions if the lane groupings are not clear to users who are making 
choices of which lane to use for payment.  Potential safety hazards particularly exist when 
approaching and departing ETC dedicated lanes.  When an driver unfamiliar with the toll 
plaza realizes their vehicle is in the wrong payment lane and suddenly stops, a following 
high-speed, ETC–equipped vehicle can easily collide with the stopped vehicle.  
Consequently, speed variance is another important factor to be considered at mixed use toll 
facilities.  Similarly, merging and weaving occurs on the departure side of the plaza as the 
number of toll lanes tapers down to the width of the continuing mainline. 
 
Various studies and reports have presented summaries of the state-of-the-practice within 
the industry, primarily related to specific design elements or practices of toll agencies.  The 
present environment is seeing significant increases in new toll highway miles, resulting in 
more toll plazas, most of which include high speed express lanes for ETC users only. 
Further trends show toll roads facing greater commuter and recreational demands, resulting 
in cash paying and ETC users familiar with the toll road mixed with unfamiliar cash paying 
users.  Without the use of good design practice, including effective deployment of various 
traffic control devices, this mix can result in unsafe and inefficient operations.  ETC users 
now expect non-stop, high speed travel through toll plazas without incurring any delays. 
Development of national guidelines that address the implications of electronic toll 
collection on plaza operations has therefore become much more critical.   
 
Toll plazas have been designed and constructed in the United States without the benefit of 
national toll plaza design guidelines and standards, often resulting in driver unfamiliarity 
and inefficient vehicle throughput.  Without national guidelines and standards, designs have 
evolved placing undue focus on monetary constraints, deploying signs with too little or too 
much information, inefficiently configuring toll lanes and embodying design features with 
greater emphasis on establishing a unique identity than on plaza safety and operations.  As 
a result, toll plaza design elements and practices vary from agency to agency, and are often 
dictated by either legacy toll plaza design practices or variations to historical designs that 
retains a distinctive appearance while incorporating enhancements to correct deficiencies.

also vary by agency.  In further complicating operations and adding driver confusion, some 
agencies have enacted variable pricing schemes to reduce plaza delays by shifting travel 
demand.  
 
Improvements and modifications to existing plazas are impacted by right-of-way 
constraints, requirements for maintenance of traffic and revenue, provisions for future 
improvements and budget considerations.  Few agencies can afford to construct entirely 
new toll plazas that incorporate design features to maximize safety and efficient plaza 
operations.  Incremental changes, however, may lack sufficient design analyses and 
incorporate minimum design elements needed for safe and efficient operations.  Increases 
in plaza collisions and operational performance deficiencies often result from these 
incremental changes. 
 
In contrast to traditional public highway departments and agencies when considering the 
application of traffic control devices, a toll agency has to follow a different business-
customer philosophy.  In addition to the various legacy provisions and constraints 
described earlier, the agency must consider their customer base, and how they can equitably 
serve the various customer groups (i.e. short-trip/long-trip, commuter/recreational, etc).  
With the use of electronic toll collection technology, the manner that the toll agency 
markets and serves their customer base through its business rules and ETC fulfillment 
procedures will affect toll plaza operations. The degree of success in implementing this 
business-customer philosophy along with good engineering judgment will dictate the best 
application of various traffic control strategies and devices. 
 
1.3 STUDY OBJECTIVES 
 
For the purposes of this report, the following description of traffic control devices will be 
used based on the MUTCD: 
 
“Traffic control devices shall be defined as all signs, signals, markings, and other devices 
used to regulate, warn, or guide traffic; placed on, over, or adjacent to the highway, bridge 
or tunnel by the authority having jurisdiction.” 
 
Below are the Project study objectives: 
 
· Enhance safety (customer, employees and visitors), 
· Improve efficiency,  
· Increase uniformity in traffic control devices to breed recognition and familiarity, 
· Build consensus (amongst toll agencies and departments). 
 
The purpose of traffic control devices, as well as the principles for their use, is to promote 
highway safety and efficiency by providing for the orderly movement of all road users at 
points of conflict and where control and information are needed to achieve these purposes.  
Traffic control devices inform road users of regulations and provide warning and guidance 
needed for the safe, uniform, and efficient operation of all vehicles comprising the traffic 
stream.  Uniformity and consistency of the meaning, location, and operation of traffic 
control devices is vital to their effectiveness.  Uniformity of devices helps road users

because control devices are vital to their effectiveness.  Uniformity of devices helps road 
users because it aids in recognition and understanding, thereby reducing perception/
reaction time.  Uniformity assists road users, law enforcement officers, and traffic courts by 
removing ambiguities and misunderstandings of the proper  interpretation.  Uniformity 
assists tollway and public highway officials through efficiency in procurement, installation, 
maintenance, and administration.  To achieve uniformity and consistency in the application 
and location of traffic control devices for toll plazas, a consensus amongst toll agencies 
must be built.   
 
1.4 METHODOLOGY 
  
The following sections describe the work tasks for this Project: 
 
 
1.4.1 Literature Review 
 
The project team researched, collected and compiled available literature related to toll plaza 
design, safety and operations and used this information to validate design elements and 
practices having a high frequency of use by agencies and state DOTs.  Concurrent with the 
literature review, existing plaza design standards and guidelines were obtained through 
contacts with representatives of a cross section of toll agencies based on selected ranges of 
daily transactions. 
 
A summary of these findings are included in Appendix C. 
 
1.4.2 Agency State-of-the-Practice Surveys 
 
An extensive Web-based survey requesting predominately simple responses to questions on 
multiple categories of toll plaza design elements and practices was prepared using JAVA 
scripts. Toll agencies identified through the International Bridge, Tunnel and Turnpike 
Association (IBTTA) member roster and the Project team’s contacts were notified by email 
of the need for their cooperation in completing the survey to establish a coherent state-of-
the-practice for traffic control strategies at toll plazas. The Web site address, along with 
user access instructions, were included in the notification email. The purpose and focus of 
the Project  survey was publicized in IBTTA newsletters in the hope of improving agency 
participation in the survey. 
 
In the interest of reducing the time required for toll agencies and departments to complete 
the survey, a multiple choice format was used for the design, safety and operational 
performance-related questions intended to solicit information on design elements and 
practices deployed on the responder’s toll facility.  The results of the survey were compiled 
to assess current practices, and the variation that exists in the toll industry.  
 
A survey result summary is included in Appendix A.

2004 in Lisle, Illinois.  The Expert Panel consisted of seven panel members, four Project 
Team members, and observers from FHWA and the International Bridge, Tunnel and 
Turnpike Association (IBTTA).  Panel members were selected to represent a wide range of 
toll facility, traffic engineering and toll technology experience.   
 
A program agenda was prepared that disaggregated the Project study into four distinct 
categories for discussion purposes. The survey results and summaries of selected design 
elements were provided at the workshop.  These materials, together with a brief program 
overview, were the basis for the Expert Panel workshop discussions.  A presentation on 
toll plaza signing, hardware and equipment was used to illustrate the variety of usage and 
generate discussion. 
 
Discussions and recommendations from the Expert Panel workshop are summarized in an 
Appendix B. 
 
1.4.4 Developing Design Guidelines  
 
Experts on the project team were tasked to develop design guidelines based upon the 
literature review, state-of-the-practice surveys and expert panel consensus building, starting 
with a workshop and concluding with incorporation or resolution of operating agency 
comments on a  draft of this Report after completion of an internal review .  Guidelines are 
presented in the subsequent chapters of this report along with the reasoning, methodology, 
and/or analysis used in the derivation of the guidelines.  A draft report was distributed to 
all key operating agencies of toll plazas and other interested FHWA partner organizations.  
This Best Practice Report incorporates comments received from agencies, departments and 
partners.   
 
1.5 USE OF DOCUMENTATION 
 
This report contains two primary components, a review of the state-of-the-practice and a 
derivation of proposed guidelines primarily based on the design elements surveyed for this 
Project and researched from related literature. The guidelines presented in this report are a 
synthesis of this information by the authors. While the accuracy of the information 
gathered and presented in this report has survived a reasonableness test by the author’s 
peers, the accuracy of the information presented has not been field verified.  This report 
does not constitute a standard, specification, or regulation.  
 
Operating agencies of toll plaza facilities must consider the suitability of the guidelines to 
their facility and fully assess the implications if an implementation follows one or more 
guideline(s). Changes to existing plazas may result in user confusion, depending on the 
nature of the change.  Consequently, it is important to consider any changes in the context 
of the overall System if an agency operates more than one toll plaza, to maintain uniformity 
throughout the entire network.   
 
The following chapters address the subject topics for mainline, ramp, bridge and tunnel toll 
plazas even though the survey focused on mainline plazas for roadways, bridges and 
tunnels.  “Qualifiers” are used when appropriate, as non-mainline plazas have more unique 
factors to address.  Plazas on ramps or interchanges vary greatly in size, depending on the

facility.  Though ramps usually have lower design speeds than mainline sections, curved 
sections and other geometric challenges are common.  Toll plazas for bridges and tunnels 
are typically situated at the extremities of these facilities, sometimes only on one side and in 
one direction.  Bridges and tunnels often have limited right-of-way and constrained space 
overall to accommodate toll plazas.  In addition, the feeder routes into some bridges and 
tunnels are not high-speed roadways.   
 
It should be noted that visibility, design speeds and geometric constraints may greatly affect 
any recommended guidelines, and engineering judgment should always be used in the 
application of traffic control strategies and deployment of devices.

CHAPTER 2 
PLAZA OPERATIONS  
AND TOLL LANE CONFIGURATION 
 
2.1 PLAZA LOCATION 
 
Toll plazas were originally designed to provide a venue for vehicles to stop and pay a toll 
with some protection from precipitation.  The specific venue was and still is guided by the 
facility’s toll operations concept, or toll system.  This, in turn, is guided by the facility’s 
business rules and requirements that are established based on traffic characteristics, 
revenue requirements, maintenance considerations, and site opportunities and constraints.  
 
Two general types of toll collection systems are in use today.  One is the "closed entry-exit 
system", or “ticket system,” so named because motorists are issued tickets at the entry 
points, and they surrender those tickets on exit.  The ticket identifies the length of the trip, 
which is used to determine the fare in conjunction with the vehicle classification.  Ticket 
systems are generally “closed,” meaning no free movements are permitted on the system. 
 
The second collection system is the “barrier system,” which collects a set toll at a specific 
location along a toll facility based only on vehicle classification.  Barrier systems may be 
“open” or “closed”. Closed barrier systems have adequate mainline and ramp toll plaza 
locations so no free movements are allowed anywhere on the toll facility.  Open barrier 
systems allow some free movements between interchanges. 
 
Once the specific type of toll collection is selected, plaza location is selected based on right 
of way availability, proximity to interchanges, geometrics, stopping sight distance, ease of 
utility access, environmental impacts, and proximity to residential neighborhoods. 
 
2.1.1 State of the Practice- Ticket System 
Deployment  
States having major ticket-system toll operations in the US include Florida, Indiana, 
Kansas, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Pennsylvania.  
These toll facilities were all built as ticket-system roads between the 1940s and 1960s.  
However, because of traffic and operations challenges, no new toll roads in the US have 
been built with a ticket system since then.  Most operators have converted some portions 
of their facilities from the ticket-system to the barrier system.  Toll road sections with 
lower traffic volumes and large distances between interchanges still function acceptably 
well as ticket-system operations.  The only US roads still operating ticket-system toll 
collection in major metropolitan areas are the New Jersey and Pennsylvania Turnpikes.

All toll collection points on ticket system toll roads are either at the system end-points, or at 
every interchange between those endpoints.  Every vehicular movement on the system must 
pass through an entry toll lane and an exit toll lane.  Trumpet interchange configurations 
(Exhibit 2-1) were used in order to bring all interchange traffic to a single point to minimize 
plaza and building construction, and minimize the cost and complexity of cash-handling 
operations.  Entry lanes can be operated in either an attended or an unattended fashion 
using ticket-issuing machines.  Because the toll amount varies with each vehicle, automation 
of cash collection was not possible, and all “exit” lanes were built as attended lanes.  
 
As a result of all exit lanes being attended, and the toll amount varying from vehicle to 
vehicle, ticket-system exit lanes with substantial commercial vehicles process traffic at a very 
slow rate, often in the range of 180 to 240 vehicles per hour (vph).  Ticket system entry 
lanes, whether attended or unattended, process vehicles more quickly and have similar 
performance to barrier plazas, with throughputs in car-only lanes around 600 vph.  
 
Location Requirements for Personnel Support  
Ticket system exit lanes must be staffed, so all plazas on a ticket-system road require 
buildings and infrastructure to support attended operations, such as personnel support, 
parking, cash handling security features, material and equipment storage, utilities, break and 
restrooms, back-up emergency generators, and other support features.  Therefore, all the 
ticket-system access points provide positive access control, and the attendant ability to close 
off or meter access when desired, such as during dangerous weather conditions.  The 
building, infrastructure, storage, and parking all limit the space available for plaza pavement, 
particularly with respect to sight distances, acceleration/deceleration lengths, room for 
weaving, etc. 
 
Plaza Locations and Geometric Limitations  
Trumpet interchange ramps provide short tangent sections on which to locate and construct 
a toll plaza.  Traffic approaching the plaza is merging from at least two ramps, and traffic 
leaving the plaza is diverging into at least two directions. There is limited space for vehicle 
storage in queues before lane access becomes blocked.  There is little time for drivers to 
make decisions on toll lane selection or direction of travel. As a result, ticket system 
interchange plazas are characterized by slow vehicular movement and weaving through the 
interchange; relatively low throughput capacity; and a limited capacity of queue storage 
before impacting merging or diverging traffic.  Operations can break down quickly in peak 
periods.  Consider an example of a typical ticket plaza with three entry lanes and five exit 
lanes, such as the Pennsylvania Turnpike Irwin interchange.  The total storage area for the 
exit lanes after both eastbound and westbound traffic merge might be 100 passenger cars or 
a smaller number of vehicles if there is a commercial vehicle mix.   The five exit lanes can 
process 180 to 220 vph each or 900 to 1,100 vph collectively.  If peak hour traffic to a major 
intersecting route reached 2,000 vph, the theoretical capacity of a single exit ramp lane, a 
substantial queue would quickly develop. 
 
Plaza Locations and Growth Limitations  
Because of the geometric constraints of the trumpet interchange, it is often difficult or 
impossible to widen these plazas beyond a relatively small number of lanes. To fit in 
additional lanes, designers must use substandard taper rates, storage lengths, roadway grades 
and cross slopes.

The addition of multiple lane types and non-stop electronic toll collection (ETC) lanes in 
ticket-system interchange plazas is difficult.  Limited sight distances, the need for quick 
driver decision making, and little room for weaving and merging (often only 300 to 500 
feet) are characteristics of ticket system interchange plazas. 
 
2.1.2 State of the Practice - Barrier System 
 
Deployment   
The barrier system concept of toll operations has been used almost universally on all new 
US toll facilities built since the 1960s.  In the early 1990’s the conventional barrier plaza 
was supplemented by non-stop express lanes employing ETC as the single method of 
payment, complemented by a license plate capture system for violators. 
 
Location Rationale 
All toll collection points on the barrier system charge a flat fee to authorize use of a fixed 
length of a toll facility by a particular vehicle type.  In the cases of bridges or tunnels and 
shorter toll roads, this single toll represents the fee to use the entire facility.  Plaza location 
is a matter of economics and opportunity (i.e., where developable right of way exists and 
can be reasonably acquired across the mainline roadway section).  In the cases of bridges 
and tunnels, unconventional location solutions, such as suspending the administration/
plaza building from the underside of the bridge and abutting the plaza/administration 
building to the toll lanes, as is the case for the Tobin Bridge and Lincoln Tunnel, 
respectively, are sometimes necessary.   
 
A barrier system will typically have one or more mainline plazas (or one pair for both 
directions of traffic) that charge the toll for a specific segment of the system.  This segment 
would typically range from 10 to 30 miles.  For example, a toll road financed on a 10¢ per 
passenger car mile basis and is 30 miles long could have two mainline barrier plazas which 
each charge $1.50. 
 
Some barrier systems allow free movements on specific short segments between the barrier 
plazas.  Most barriers systems, however, are “closed” in that they prevent free movements 
through the strategic location of interchange ramp toll plazas.  Not all interchanges and 
ramp movements need to be tolled to meet this requirement.  Plaza locations will typically 
be selected so that freeway facilities owned by state departments of transportation (DOTs) 
and high volume and speed interchanges may be constructed without ramp toll plazas.  For 
example, it is often desirable to avoid locating conventional toll plazas at an interstate-to-
interstate interchange with multiple high-speed directional ramps.  The Illinois Tollway 
designed the new I-355 / I-55 interchange (Exhibit 2-3) in this manner (i.e., I-355 has two 
barrier plazas at each end and the centrally located I-55 interchange does not have ramp toll 
plazas). 
 
Location Requirements for Personnel Support 
Mainline barrier plazas have traditionally been attended facilities, with various 
improvements for personnel assigned to work on the site including offices, parking, cash 
handling security, utilities, emergency generators, material, and equipment storage, and 
other personnel support features.  Barrier system ramp plazas often operate unattended.  
These plazas still require some infrastructure and utility support (e.g., power and

communications), but the scale of site improvements is substantially reduced, and therefore 
allow more flexibility in location than attended facilities. 
 
Plaza Locations and Geometric Limitations 
Because mainline plazas restrain or meter passage on high-speed routes, locations are 
generally selected where the required right of way can be reasonably acquired, adequate 
stopping sight distance exists, profile grade is relatively flat, and a sufficient length of 
roadway is on a tangent section.  Geometric limitations are less than those encountered 
when locating ramp plazas, although constraints on design may be imposed by portal or 
approach features at tunnel or bridge crossings, as well as economic development along 
plaza rights of way. 
 
Trumpet interchanges do not accommodate barrier system ramp plazas easily, primarily 
because two of the four typical movements through the trumpet interchange are not tolled, 
and so free lanes must be segregated from the toll lanes.  Barrier system ramp plazas 
typically follow the interchange design, with the exception that individual ramps need to be 
several hundred feet longer and comply with stopping sight distance standards in advance 
of a small two- or three-lane ramp plaza. 
 
Vehicle processing speeds are faster than in ticket-system exit lanes, and implementing a 
non-stop ETC lane requires less transaction processing.  Nonetheless, interchange ramp 
designs must often be altered to provide additional tangent length and transverse space for 
locating a small toll plaza with some expansion capability. 
 
Plaza Sizing and Growth Limitations 
When the policy is to require vehicles to stop to pay the toll, plaza design must account for 
the required number of lanes based on a composite vehicle throughput, and the amount of 
approach pavement required for safe vehicle storage.  Alternative plaza locations may need 
to be considered if the available plaza width is inadequate. 
 
The addition of non-stop lanes adds new considerations. Dedicated lane design requires the 
provision for signing and pavement markings to keep dedicated lane approaches open, 
particularly when the cash lanes have long vehicle queues.  Express lane design requires the 
physical separation between vehicles moving at high speed and vehicles either at rest 
waiting to pay the toll or decelerating while approaching the plaza.  For plazas combining 
express lanes and a conventional plaza, the approach and departure length requirements 
become paramount.  These plazas should be located at least one mile from the nearest 
interchange. 
 
2.1.3 State of the Practice - Future Systems 
 
From 1989 until 2004, the percentage of tolls collected by electronic toll collection has 
increased from 0% to 40% or more at almost all US toll facilities.  Cash-paying toll traffic 
constitutes the minority traffic component for many toll facilities.  ETC usage is even 
greater during peak hour periods.  In the case of the Orlando-Orange County Expressway 
Authority (OOCEA) and the Illinois Tollway, if the 24-hour ADT percentage of ETC 
participation is, for example, 50%, the peak hour penetration typically exceeds the ADT

 figure by 5% to 10%.  This can be attributed to the appeal of ETC in improving traffic 
flow and reducing delays during congested, peak periods. 
 
New toll agencies or projects begun after 1990, such as E-470 in Denver, Colorado, TCA 
in Orange County, California, and Delaware have designed their facilities so cash toll 
collection could be removed by simply closing the cash lanes.  New toll facilities overseas, 
and some US facilities are now in operation without provisions for cash toll collection (i.e., 
no conventional plazas).  These existing toll facilities include the following: 
 
 
  
 
Much research and writing has focused on the fact that cash toll collection requires users to 
stop their vehicle to pay a toll, and is not popular with the toll road customer base.  As 
ETC becomes more popular and ubiquitous in the future, existing toll road operators will 
need to make as many accommodations as possible to provide what their customers are 
demanding. 
 
The implication here is that a toll agency should not focus on a particular “design” or 
future percentage of ETC transactions resulting in a required cash toll collection capability 
to handle the remaining transactions.  Rather, all new facilities should be designed to 
support no more than today’s quantity of cash transactions, and be easily converted to all 
electronic operations involving ETC supplemented by some form of video tolling or 
temporary electronic passes to accommodate users without a transponder.

2.1.5 Recommended Guidelines 
 
Plaza Location and Collection Design Issues 
As toll collection moves increasingly from cash-based to account-based, the need for traffic 
to stop to transact a toll decreases.  In 1988, no tolls were collected electronically using 
radio frequency identification (RFID) technology.  By the end of 2004, many US operators 
collected at least half of their tolls via electronic toll collection using RFID technology.  
Toll operators at the Florida’s Turnpike and Illinois Tollway have publicly stated they target 
75% market penetration of their electronic toll collection programs.  
 
Several new toll facilities have been built without cash toll collection, and several more are 
in development at the time of this writing.  Necessity such as lack of right of way and 
partially completed “freeway grade” structures supported use of an all-electronic design for 
SR-91 in California and 407 ETR in Toronto, respectively.  Florida’s Turnpike is preparing 
to completely remove the existing plazas from the 23-mile Sawgrass Expressway, and 
convert this facility to all-electronic toll collection. 
 
The precedent set by the operation of non-stop toll facilities around the country is 
expected to result in toll customers increasingly not wanting to stop in a toll plaza 
environment, thereby limiting the life of conventional plazas, certainly less than the 
expected life of the underlying tolled highways, bridges or tunnels. 
 
Proposed plaza construction and modifications should be designed with anticipation of 
increasing ETC utilization, and eventual removal of conventional plazas, at least for the 
purpose of toll collection (bridge and tunnel operators may wish to retain plazas for 
inspection and security reasons).  Plaza locations should be selected, whenever possible, to 
accommodate high-speed operations and roadways for possibly obtaining a temporary pass 
to use the facility.  Inherent in this approach, particularly for conversions, is the likelihood 
ETC will need to be supplemented by video tolling, temporary electronic passes, or some 
other means of high speed, non-stop collection to accommodate users without a 
transponder.  
 
Plaza Location and Collection Guideline Development 
Some design measures that would aide the owner in preparing for future growth in ETC 
usage are the following: 
 
a. Provision for adequate ETC lanes to the extent that almost 100% of the approach 
roadway volume has an express lane or ETC dedicated lane to use.  This suggests a 1:1 
design relationship between ETC lanes and the approach or departure roadway lanes. 
 
b. Simplification of the offered plaza lanes to only two types of toll collection.  This 
greatly enables quick decision-making, which is increasingly the environment in which 
toll operations are conducted. 
 
c. Economical conventional plaza design and construction is desirable where there is no 
existing regional use of ETC, cash collection metering affectively improves facility

operations, and relatively low commuter traffic volumes are forecasted.    
 
The expectation based on recent toll facility projects is new mainline toll plaza requirements 
will include non-stop ETC express lanes, and new ramp plaza requirements will include non-
stop ETC dedicated lanes.  In these cases, the driver approaching a plaza will have to make a 
choice between the non-stop lanes and the conventional plaza lanes or adjacent cash lane(s). 
 
Plaza Location Guidelines 
 
 
 
Guideline Plaza Locations Guideline 1 
Title Plaza and Interchange Intervals 
Text The 2001 AASHTO A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets (the 
“Green Book”) recommends separation of 1 mile (urban sections) or 3 
miles (rural sections) between interchanges.  This criteria should be used as 
a guideline for selection of new mainline toll plaza sites (i.e., the interstate 
standards require 1 mile to the nearest interchange in urban areas and 3 
miles in rural areas). 
Commentary Although it may not be possible to meet this design guideline at bridge and 
tunnel crossings, the interval spacing minimums should remain a goal. 
Guideline Plaza Locations Guideline 2 
Title Site Selection and Sight Distance 
Text New toll plazas should be sited such that motorists will be able to see the 
plaza, while driving at posted speeds with adequate stopping sight distance 
before the queue zone. The plaza site should be on a tangent pavement 
section. 
Commentary None. 
Guideline Plaza Locations Guideline 3 
Title Ramp Plaza Movements 
Text New toll plazas should not have merging or diverging movements within 
the plaza approach and departure zones.  New plaza construction should 
not occur within trumpet interchange areas, if possible. 
Commentary Some existing toll plaza locations have merging and diverging movements 
within the plaza approach and departure zones.  Other appropriate 
treatment options could be applied to improve their operations.

2.2 DEDICATED LANES 
 
The first non-stop electronic toll collection lanes in the U.S. were “dedicated lanes”. Since 
Then current implementations have been developed under a variety of opportunities and 
constraints.  Some agencies (New York, Illinois, Pennsylvania, OOCEA and the Florida’s 
Turnpike Enterprise, among others) converted existing cash lanes to create dedicated lanes 
while others, such as the Delaware River and Bay Authority, have built new plazas 
incorporating dedicated lanes.  In many cases conversions began with single lanes and then 
were expanded, incorporating specific traffic control design features along with other 
performance and safety enhancing changes at various stages of the conversion.  As a result, 
there are quite a wide variety of dedicated lane implementations. 
2.2.1 State of the Practice 
 
The following are general characteristics of an ETC dedicated lane.  While it is recognized 
there are exceptions to every rule regarding dedicated lanes, these items are deemed to be 
representative of common practice. 
 
Non-stop ETC lanes meeting all of the following requirements are typically described as 
ETC dedicated lanes: 
 
a.  Located within a conventional plaza and sharing the same approach and 
departure zone pavement; 
 
b. Located in the center or to the left of the conventional plaza and similar in 
appearance to the other conventional plaza lanes;  
 
c. Single toll lanes of traffic with minimal or no shoulders;   
 
d. Separated by either toll plaza islands of the same width as the cash collection 
lanes or barrier if the lanes do not need to be crossed by plaza staff. 
 
Dedicated lanes result in mixing non-stop traffic into an often congested area designed for 
vehicles waiting in queues to pay the designated toll.  Dedicated lanes within a conventional 
plaza should be designed to avoid giving a user the impression high-speed travel is allowed 
in these lanes. 
 
Some operators (e.g., HCTRA in the Houston metropolitan area) built plazas with multiple 
lanes without islands between them.  Even though the other criteria enumerated above 
would be met, multiple adjacent lanes should be treated as express lanes, because of the 
appearance as a higher grade of non-stop toll operations. 
2.2.2 Survey Results 
Although the survey results come from a relatively limited group of responses from toll highway 
and bridge operators, observation of other toll facilities indicate consistent support for the 
most popular practices.

Dedicated Lane Plaza Orientation 
Almost 90% of responding toll road operators have ETC dedicated lanes, most with 
multiple dedicated lanes per direction.  Most operators and all bridge operators group 
dedicated lanes together within the conventional plaza.  The dedicated lanes are typically 
located to the left of the manual lanes. 
 
Although not captured by the survey results, ramp plazas are often configured differently 
because of shorter approach zones, a curved roadway alignments, and proximity to other 
merges or directional splits.  Two agencies in Florida, and the Illinois Tollway, among 
others, locate some or all ramp plaza dedicated lanes to the right, for operational and 
service reasons.  Plazas located on trumpet interchange ramps may group ETC dedicated in 
the middle of the plaza to equally service traffic entering the plaza from multiple directions. 
 
Dedicated Lane Separation – Same Direction of Traffic 
Toll plazas often use extended raised pavement markers within the queue area to augment 
signing on the plaza canopy and along the approach, as well as extended solid white 
pavement markings.  While this does not provide physical separation, it does help the 
driver to quickly identify dedicated lanes, and segregate vehicles that are preparing to a stop 
from those slowing down as needed to navigate a dedicated lane. Raised pavement 
markings, delineators and solid white markings are also used in the recovery zone.   
 
Dedicated Lane Separation – Opposing Direction of Traffic 
Most survey respondents operate plazas with contiguous opposing directions of traffic, but 
only six of the thirteen physically separate the directions of traffic with a permanent barrier. 
 
Dedicated Lane Utilization  
Of fifteen respondents with multiple dedicated lanes, only two operate lanes restricted to 
cars.  Only one agency had installed dedicated lanes restricted to trucks (not captured by 
the survey since the dedicated lanes were in the process of being converted to mixed use).  
The majority of toll road facilities operate dedicated lanes without restriction of vehicles 
classes.  Vehicle type, size or height restrictions may be used at tunnel and bridge toll plazas 
out of necessity due to structural limitations and safety considerations. 
 
Dedicated Lane Width  
The average lane width reported was over 11 feet (3.4m), and 12 feet (3.6m) was the most 
common response. One bridge responded, with a 14-foot (4.3m) lane width.  As expected, 
newer facilities have wider toll lanes than older plaza facilities. 
 
Dedicated Lane Island Widths  
These responses varied between only two feet (0.6m) and 16 feet (4.9m).  Six to seven feet 
(1.8m to 2.1m) was the most common survey response. 
 
Island widths for dedicated lanes are often established well before the introduction of ETC 
into a conventional plaza and subsequent conversion of cash lanes to dedicated lanes.  
Island widths can be reduced to gain lane width when toll lanes are converted to dedicated 
lanes, although this increases construction costs and time.  Many agencies have adopted 
standards for toll plaza design.  These standards and design practices reflect operating 
policies and operational and safety requirements, such as the spacing of stairwells for tunnel

Dedicated Lane Posted Speeds 
The reported posted speeds ranged from 5 mph to 45 mph (8 kph to 70 kph) with an 
average of about 26 mph (42 kph).  Typical bridge dedicated lane speeds were lower. 
 
Excessive speed through dedicated lanes presents a challenge that all toll facilities 
incorporating ETC dedicated lanes must face with varying severity.  The 85th percentile 
operating speeds tend to exceed posted speeds, sometimes by substantial margins.  
Operators implement a variety of measures to encourage or mandate speed compliance.

2.2.4 Recommended Guidelines 
 
Dedicated Lane Design Issues 
Existing design standards have provided little guidance on the subject of dedicated lane 
design, except for some work by the Institute of Transportation Engineers. Current 
AASHTO or MUTCD guidelines do not offer guidance in the design of dedicated lanes.   
 
Some important facts regarding the evolution of ETC dedicated lanes are the following:  
 
a. Developed on a trial-and-error basis by pioneering toll agencies; 
 
b. Made significant contributions to improved traffic capacity at toll plazas; 
 
c. Demonstrated throughput capacities of 1,200 vph to 1,500 vph, on the low end. 
 
Non-stop lanes make the drivers’ use of a toll plaza more difficult, in that more decisions 
are required to navigate the plaza.  In the case of many survey respondents, ETC 
dedicated lanes represent a third type of toll lane, which may be further complicated by 
other restrictions, such as cars or trucks only.  Consequently, the driver’s attention is 
often drawn to canopy signs, lane use signals and pavement markings, and much less to 
nearby vehicles.  The case study by Mohamed, Abdel-Aty and Klodzinksi reviews how 
conflicts in lane selection can lead to increased accidents.¹ 
 
Differential speeds resulting from differences in non-stop and stop-and-go traffic flow 
corresponding to dedicated lane and cash lane usage, respectively, needs to be minimized 
within the  approach and departure zones.  
 
Dedicated Lane Guideline Development 
Good design of a toll plaza with dedicated lanes should not only consider applicability of 
the individual guidelines from each section, but should view the guidelines collectively to 
derive symbiotic benefits that exceed the benefits derived when the guidelines are 
individually adopted (i.e., the whole exceeds the sum of the parts).   
 
With ETC dedicated lanes now able to process the majority of traffic in peak traffic 
periods, the sometimes marginal benefit-cost ratio associated with automatic coin 
machines (ACM) justifies consideration of converting ACM lanes to ETC dedicated 
lanes. Coin machine lanes were developed long before development of ETC technology, 
and were intended to increase vehicle processing without incurring a continuous 
operations labor cost. Now, ETC dedicated lanes far exceed the original objectives of 
coin machines.  The elimination of coin machine lanes, when feasible, reduces the 
number of lane types a driver can select during the approach to the toll plaza.  
Consequently, drivers can spend more time viewing their surroundings and be better 
prepared to take defensive measures to avoid potential incidents.

Some operational constraints at bridge and tunnel crossings require unusual measures, 
such as partial facility closures or contra-flow traffic operations during maintenance 
periods such as tunnel cleaning or bridge deck repairs.  During these periods, existing 
pavement markings and signing may not apply, resulting in sometimes complex traffic 
control and guidance that may not be anticipated by drivers intending to use a particular 
bridge or tunnel crossing. In addition, at facilities with limited plaza space and prone to 
bottlenecks, a case could made for implementing only mixed-use toll lanes that include 
both ETC and cash operations. 
 
Pavement markings can be used to separate dedicated lanes from cash lanes for a length 
of approximately one half of the queue zone.  This not only follows the intent of the 
AASHTO recommended lane separation, but also helps to identify a boundary to avoid 
straying into by vehicles waiting in queues. 
 
Dedicated Lane Guidelines  
Based on the survey results, observation of existing practices, and published research 
literature,² the following dedicated lane guidelines are formulated to remedy this missing 
guidance: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2)  Contribution to the Development of Guidelines for Toll Plaza design,” Journal of 
Transportation Engineering, May/June 2001, McDonald and Stammer. 
Guideline ETC Dedicated Lane Guideline 1 
Title ETC Dedicated Lane Count 
Text For new construction, where express lanes are not feasible, the 
number of dedicated lanes should at least equal the number of 
approach roadway lanes or the total roadway design volume divided 
by 1,500. 
Commentary This provision is intended to assure a given toll plaza will not require 
future modifications or lane conversions to meet customer demand 
for non-stop lanes.  In theory, it may be appropriate to defer 
implementation of dedicated lanes for new toll plaza construction, and 
rely on mixed-use lanes until ETC participation increases to fully 
support the use dedicated lanes. 
In practice, new toll roads rely heavily on non-stop ETC to garner 
public support and acceptance.

Guideline ETC Dedicated Lane Guideline 2 
Title ETC Dedicated Lane Orientation – Mainline Toll Plazas 
Text Where possible, lanes accepting the same payment types should be 
clustered.  On mainline plazas, dedicated lanes should be clustered to the 
left as vehicles approach the plaza. 
Commentary Exceptions may be warranted when approach or departure zones are 
located on interchange ramps, or high volumes of commercial traffic are 
present.  Under these conditions, a supplemental dedicated lane towards 
the right of the plaza to support traffic entering or exiting the system in 
multiple directions, or to isolate ETC commercial vehicles away from 
heavy commuter traffic in the left dedicated lanes, may be warranted. 
Guideline ETC Dedicated Lane Guideline 3 
Title ETC Dedicated Lane Orientation – Ramp Toll Plazas 
Text Assignment of ETC dedicated lanes is dependent on ramp geometry and 
proximate merges and splits.  Consistent locations should be used to 
enable quick recognition and simplify the plaza approach for repeat drivers. 
Commentary The conversion of cash toll collection lanes into dedicated lanes at ramp 
plazas has been challenging, particularly for ticket system operators which 
have plazas located close to at least two merges and splits in trumpet 
interchanges.  Dedicated lane selection must be made based on traffic 
characteristics of the individual toll operator.  The New York Thruway, for 
example, often uses center lanes in these plazas for dedicated lanes, as this 
allows a single dedicated lane to serve traffic departing the plaza area to 
the left or the right without weaving.

Guideline ETC Dedicated Lane Guideline 4 
Title Directional Separation of Traffic – Mainline Toll Plazas 
Text As mainline plazas are upgraded with ETC dedicated lanes, opposing 
directions of traffic should be separated by permanent barrier, (or 
moveable barrier for reversible lanes) that is capable of absorbing the 
impact of a vehicle with limited movement and deflection, except where 
the separation between opposing directions equals or exceeds the 
AASHTO guidelines on highway clear zone standards. 
Commentary As ETC participation climbs above 50%, the need for reversible toll lanes 
lessens in most locations other than those with reversible mainline lanes.  
Permanent barrier is expected to assist the driver in navigating the plaza.  
Also, the task of moving cones to shift plaza centerlines is a dangerous 
field assignment, and with increasing driver speeds is becoming more 
dangerous.  Notwithstanding the use of rigidly followed safety procedures 
when visibility is good, this practice should be discontinued as soon as it is 
feasible. 
For major bridge and tunnel crossings, where significant reversible lane or 
contra-flow traffic operations are used, the use of moveable concrete 
barrier could be considered if the expense is warranted.  When available, a 
clear zone between opposing traffic directions provides an open area (i.e., 
no obstacles present) considered sufficient for a driver to regain control of 
the vehicle and avoid a collision. 
Guideline ETC Dedicated Lane Guideline 5 
Title ETC Dedicated Lane Widths 
Text Twelve feet (3.6m) is the recommended width for dedicated lanes that 
allow commercial vehicles (CV).  For dedicated lanes that only allow 
passenger cars, 11 feet (3.4m) is the recommended minimum width. 
Commentary Retrofits of existing plazas may deviate from these guidelines, but the 
designer needs to consider expected operating speed and protection of 
adjacent obstacles. 
Guideline ETC Dedicated Lane Guideline 6 
Title ETC Dedicated Lane Island Widths 
Text In the absence of any other site conditions or safety requirements, 
dedicated lane islands should replicate the dimensions of other 
conventional plaza islands, in accordance with any agency or adopted 
design standards. 
Commentary For new or reconstructed facilities, island width should be dictated by the 
more controlling toll booth width plus lane clearance or lane clearance 
plus safe access to toll island equipment.

2.3 EXPRESS LANES 
2.3.1 State of the Practice 
 
The first high-speed non-stop electronic toll collection lanes in the US were “express lanes” 
built with new construction on Oklahoma’s Kilpatrick Turnpike, and Denver’s E-470 in 
1991.  Others followed shortly in Georgia, Texas and California.  The Illinois Tollway 
constructed the first plaza conversion to provide express lanes in 1999.  Current practice 
has been developed under a variety of design guidelines, but the implementations are more 
consistent than in the case of dedicated lanes. 
 
Non-stop ETC lanes meeting all the following requirements are typically described as ETC 
Express Lanes: 
 
· The approach and departure zone is partially or completely separated from the 
approach and departure zone of the conventional plaza. 
 
· Consist of either a single toll lane with shoulders, or multiple traffic lanes with or 
without shoulders designated by pavement markings.  
 
· Lane width is equal to the mainline lane width. 
 
· Lanes abut with no toll island separation for multi-lane sections. 
 
· Roadside barrier is used where obstacles such as gantry supports are located within 
the clear zone. 
 
Express lanes are physically separated from the adjacent conventional plaza toll lanes. 
Some facilities have “express lanes” that generally meet the design criteria given above, but 
still require vehicles to slow down below the posted highway operating speeds and to make 
merge and diverge movements in navigating the toll site.  Passenger cars, buses, and trucks 
should be allowed to use the express lanes given the current capability of automatic vehicle 
classification equipment and devices.  The only exception would be for a single express 
lane, in which case consideration should be given to banning trucks because of delays 
caused by these slower moving vehicles. For this reason, and because of problems caused 
by stalls and other lane blockages, a single express lane design should be avoided under 
mixed traffic flow conditions.  
 
Since the advent of zero-cash toll collection, the term “Open Road Tolling,” or “ORT,” 
has come into use.  ORT was originally used to refer to “all-electronic” facilities, such as 
SR-91, Toronto 407 ETR, Melbourne CityLink and the Cross-Israel Highway.  Usage of 
this term has evolved to also refer to non-stop lanes in which the express lane cross section 
exactly matches the upstream mainline toll road cross-section.  For example, a road with 
10’ right shoulder, three 12’ lanes, and an 11’ left shoulder on the mainline would have the 
same express lane cross section through the tolling zone or point.  Access to the adjacent 
conventional toll plaza lanes would be designed the same as an interchange.

Express Lane Design Issues and Guideline Development  
When a toll road operator cannot meet the AASHTO Green Book freeway lane guidelines at a site 
due to geometric constraints such as immovable natural features or interchanges closer than one 
mile, the design should consider dedicated lanes for the conventional plaza, subject to 
accommodating design provisions for future conversion to ORT.  The AASHTO Green Book is 
predominately adopted by toll agencies and DOTs, either directly or through incorporation into their 
design standards for mainline roadway design. 
 
 
Express Lane Guidelines  
 
Based on the survey results above, the AASHTO “Green Book” and ITE guidelines, recommended 
express lane guidelines are the following: 
Guideline ETC Express Lane Guideline 2 
Title ETC Express Lane Orientation 
Text Express lanes should be oriented to the left, as a continuation of the mainline 
approach pavement. 
Commentary Express Lanes should appear to the driver as a simple continuation of the 
mainline through the tolling zone or point, not requiring any change in driving 
pattern. 
Guideline ETC Express Lane Guideline 1 
Title ETC Express Lane Count 
Text New ORT plazas should include the same number of express lanes equal to the 
number of approach roadway lanes.  A minimum of two express lanes in each 
direction should be provided when an ORT plaza may not be feasible, including 
provisions for future mainline and plaza widening. 
Commentary An ORT implementation assures that a given toll plaza will never require future 
modifications or lane conversions to meet customer demand for non-stop 
lanes.   This design guideline is important for several reasons: 
1)  The appearance of a wide-open path “through the plaza” is a very 
effective marketing tool 
2) Once constructed, future plaza changes will not be required to 
accommodate higher ETC demand at the toll facilities, assuming the 
mainline is not widened.  This eliminates additional express lane 
design and construction along with the risk of reduced revenue 
resulting from delays caused by reconstruction and high traffic control 
costs to assure user safety during reconstruction. 
This guideline applies to new construction of ORT and express lane plazas or 
re-construction of existing plazas to include express lanes.

2.4 LANE ASSIGNMENTS / CONFIGURATION 
2.4.1 State of the Practice 
 
Until the mid-1990s, many toll plazas interspersed various lane payment types, but based 
on survey responses most agencies now group their lanes by payment type.  Although 
there is variation in implementation details used by agencies, predominant practice is to 
locate dedicated lanes to the left and manual lanes to the right of conventional plazas. 
 
In many urban plazas, there are often ramp plazas located within approach or departure 
zones, as well as queue zones.  In some extreme cases, these are on the left as well as the 
right, particularly with older facilities in New York and New Jersey.  These facilities often 
mix payment types across the plaza, so that the driver can find a lane close to his or her 
intended direction of travel.  This configuration is increasingly difficult to support with 
the increased use of electronic toll collection and the concomitant differential speeds that 
degrade safe operations. 
2.4.2 Survey Results 
 
Lane Assignment of Attended (“Manual”) Lanes  
Most responding agencies group their attended lanes together.  All allow oversized 
permit vehicles to use the facility, typically in the far right lane where the toll lane or 
passageway is wider.  
 
Lane Assignment of Unattended Lanes (Automatic Coin Machines (ACM) / Automatic 
Ticket-Issuing Machines (ATIM)) 
Most responding agencies group unattended lanes to the left of attended lanes, although 
a responding bridge toll agency locates their ACM lanes to the right of the attended lanes.  
This may reflect an intent to place the higher demand lanes in the center of the plaza, 
consistent with a bell shaped distribution often observed for multiple lane queues with 
equal service rates. 
 
Lane Assignment of ETC Dedicated Lanes  
As noted in the ETC dedicated lanes discussion, most operators report they group their 
dedicated lanes to the left of the attended lanes.  Also previously noted, these lanes may 
be located in the center of the plaza when the approach zone and or departure zone 
receive and or feed, respectively, multiple directions of travel.

 2.4.4 Recommended Guidelines 
 
Lane Assignment/Configuration Design Issues  
A number of toll road operators configure one or more lanes to operate in multiple 
modes (i.e., some combination of attended, unattended and ETC dedicated lanes). The 
New York Thruway and the Orlando Orange County Expressway Authority are 
examples of operators who operate multiple mode lanes.  These lanes allow operators to 
re-configure plazas for times of varying ETC demand. For example, during peak tourist 
periods when traffic is heavy but ETC participation rates are low the lane would operate 
as attended and ETC.  Lane convertibility does not necessarily involve wholesale changes 
in modes of operation, but rather changes in the count of capability for each lane type. 
 
As average ETC penetration rates increase and dedicated lanes are added to serve the 
demand, previous throughput capacity challenges wane and the need to vary lane types to 
maximize vehicular throughput also diminishes.  As average speeds through toll plazas 
increase, the need to simplify and minimize lane selection increases.  This in turn results 
in the need to group payment types and limit the number of lane payment types. 
 
Lane Assignment/Configuration Guideline Development  
Practically, there are two configurations for ACM/ATIM lanes, depending on the need 
for reversible lanes and the location of ETC lanes.  Illinois and OOCEA, for example, 
locate their cars-only ETC lanes to the far left; with ACM lanes operated in between the 
ETC and attended dedicated lanes.  Other agencies have located the ACM lanes to the 
left, with ETC lanes in the center.  This configuration attempts to concentrate 
commercial vehicles within the plaza by grouping the lane types (i.e., ETC dedicated 
lanes and attended lanes) that these vehicles are allowed to use.  This also results in the 
lower operational cost ACM lanes being located in the center of a bidirectional 
conventional plaza, where reversible operation can be easily implemented. For all cases of 
low truck volumes and physically separated directional plazas, as the volume of ETC 
traffic increases, and the volume of  ACM traffic decreases, ETC dedicated lanes should 
be located to the left of the plaza, and the ACM lanes should be located in the center.  
This arrangement supports conversion of ACM lanes to ETC dedicated lanes instead of 
conversion of attended lanes, a process that is likely to cost significantly less. 
 
Existing agency design standards, and the current AASHTO or MUTCD guidelines and 
standards, have provided little guidance on the subject of toll plaza lane assignments and 
configurations.   
 
Lane Assignment/Configuration Guidelines  
Based on the survey results above, current trends in the industry and results of literature

Guideline Lane Assignment Guideline 3 
Title Attended Lanes 
Text Attended lanes are slower processing lanes because of truck 
transactions, receipt processing and informational assistance, and should 
be located to the right side of the conventional plaza. 
Commentary Ramp plaza lanes may need attended lanes on both the left and right 
sides to more safely accommodate traffic arriving from and or departing 
to multiple directions. 
Guideline Lane Assignment Guideline 2 
Title Permit or Over-Size Vehicles 
Text The far right lane should be sized to accept permit or oversized vehicles. 
Commentary This is consistent with common practice, and allows the slowest 
vehicles to stay to the right.  Note that if ETC dedicated lanes are 
oriented to the right of the plaza, this requires permit-vehicles to pay 
with ETC. Provisions for oversized vehicles may not be possible at 
constrained plazas and the underlying facility (e.g., size, structural 
capacity and safety considerations), particularly for bridges and tunnels. 
Guideline Lane Assignment Guideline 1 
Title Lane Clustering. 
Text All payment type lanes should be grouped together or clustered, 
particularly during peak traffic periods in the case of multi-mode 
capability.  This enables advance plaza configuration signing to enable 
early decision-making on lane selection. 
Commentary This provision is intended to enable driver decision making to be done in 
stages, first to select the payment type, then selecting a particular lane 
offering the selected payment type based on queue length and its vehicle 
composition.

Title ETC Dedicated Lanes or ETC Express Lanes 
Text ETC dedicated lanes should be grouped or clustered and located to the 
left of the conventional plaza. Consideration should be given to locating 
dedicated lanes in the center of a ramp plaza if the plaza approach or 
departure receives or feeds, respectively, multiple directions of travel. 
Mixed use express lanes, by definition, must abut, be physically 
separated from the conventional plaza, and consist of at least two lanes. 
Commentary The intent is to breed familiarity by users when traveling multiple 
facilities. 
Guideline Lane Assignment Guideline 4 
Title ACM/ATIM Lanes 
Text ACM/ATIM lanes are capable of processing vehicles at a higher rate 
than attended lanes and should be located to the left of the attended 
lanes.

 2.5 BRANCH LANES AND SATELLITE PLAZAS 
 
2.5.1 State of the Practice 
 
A practice that was common with toll roads over thirty years old was to build small 
branch or satellite plazas to increase throughput capacity.  The concept was to allow 
vehicles to either pass through an un-tolled plaza lane similar to an ETC dedicated lane, 
and then stop at a small plaza further downstream or enter a branch lane within the 
approach zone that leads to a small plaza upstream of the main conventional plaza.  The 
objective was to add approximately one to three additional toll processing lanes to the 
existing capacity.  
2.5.2 Survey Results 
 
Branch Plazas 
Only one of twenty-four agencies still uses branch plaza lanes. Vehicles pass through the 
supplemental plaza lane at an average of 37.26 mph, which is very similar to an ETC 
dedicated lane.

2.5.4 Recommended Guidelines 
 
Branch Lane and Satellite Plaza Design Issues and Guideline Development 
Branch lanes and satellite plazas are difficult to sign, create a confusing environment for 
the user to drive, and are deficient from a toll operations perspective.  The location of the 
satellite plazas makes safe access by collection and maintenance staff very difficult. Also, 
physical separation of the branch lanes using barrier results in deficient approach and 
departure tapers, adversely affecting efficient use of the plaza lanes.   
 
Branch Lane and Satellite Plaza Guidelines 
 
 
Guideline Toll Plaza Branch and Satellite Plazas Guideline 1 
Title Use of Branch and Satellite Plazas 
Text New toll plaza design should not include branch lanes and satellite 
plazas. Existing plazas containing these lanes should develop a plan for 
removal of these lanes by transitioning to ETC dedicated lanes that 
eventually provide throughput capacity equivalent to the satellite plaza 
capacity. 
Commentary As ETC participation grows after implementation, the overall plaza 
capacity increases and eliminates the need for branch and satellite 
plaza lanes.

2.6 REVERSIBLE LANES  
2.6.1 State of the Practice 
 
Reversible toll plaza lanes, in the center of bi-directional plazas, enable the operators to 
augment the plaza with additional toll lanes for directional A.M. or P.M. peak hour travel.  
 
Toll operators retain reversible lanes after upgrading their System to include ETC 
dedicated lanes in one of two manners:  1) separate the ETC dedicated lanes from the 
lanes configured  as reversible lanes, preferably resulting in the ETC dedicated lanes 
being located in the approximate center of a directional conventional plaza, or; 2) ETC 
dedicated lanes configured as reversible lanes.  
 
At mainline plazas with dedicated lane speeds above 30 mph (50 kph), operation of cash 
lanes to the left of the dedicated lanes has proven unsatisfactory from an operations 
point of view because of the difficulty cash traffic, particularly trucks, has to merge to 
and diverge from the left.  However, non-stop, reversible, dedicated lanes are potentially 
more hazardous for staff to move temporary traffic control devices than reversible 
conventional plaza cash lanes. Consequently, if the passenger car toll is less than a dollar, 
automatic lanes (i.e., ACM, ATIM) with automatic barrier gates are potentially the safest 
lane type to operate as reversible lanes. 
 
At ramp plazas, particularly trumpet interchange plazas, reversible lanes have been a 
necessity due to limited lanes and capacity constraints where traffic is highly directional.  
This is true even in relatively high ETC participation areas such as the New York 
Thruway. 
 
2.6.2 Survey Results

2.6.4 Recommended Guidelines 
 
Reversible Lane Design Issues and Guideline Development  
Reversible lanes present a potentially hazardous condition, in that cones or other moveable 
delineators/pylons must be moved in the center of a bidirectional conventional toll plaza 
when changing the direction of the reversible lanes.  In addition, if ETC dedicated lanes are 
located to the left, the added utility of reversible dedicated lanes is questionable, because a 
single approach lane normally only requires the use of a just slightly more than a single 
ETC dedicated lane. As plazas are reconstructed with express lanes to the left of the 
conventional plaza, provisions for implementing reversible lanes are affectively eliminated. 
 
In the absence of reversible lanes such as HOV lanes, managed lanes or contra-flow lanes, 
new plaza construction on new facilities should not include reversible lanes.

Reversible Lane Guidelines 
 
Guideline Reversible Toll Lane Guideline 1 
Title Use of Reversible Toll Lanes on Standard Expressway Cross-
Sections 
Text Reversible toll lanes should be avoided where possible and 
excluded from the design of new toll facilities. 
Commentary For existing barrier system plazas, it is recommended that the 
use of reversible lanes be discontinued as soon as possible for 
operations and safety reasons, as soon as ETC participation 
rates allow. 
At existing ticket-system plazas, it may be practically impossible 
to eliminate the use of reversible lanes, as overall operations are 
slow in these plazas, and additional capacity is often needed 
regardless of ETC participation.

2.7  ADMINISTRATION BUILDING AND ACCESSWAY  LOCATION 
2.7.1 State of the Practice 
 
All attended toll plazas and most unattended plazas have a roadside building structure to 
provide the operations staff cash-handling, restroom, break room and locker facilities as 
well as protection of computer and communications equipment.  A single plaza building is 
often located on the right side of one of the two directional conventional plazas. This 
building has also been located in the center of the plaza between the two directional 
conventional plazas. In both of these cases, a tunnel or overhead walkway is commonly 
used to provide safe access to the operations staff when walking to their assigned toll 
booth. In cases of limited right of way, overhead buildings have been built, such as New 
Jersey Exit 1, which provides safe and convenient access for the operations and 
maintenance staff.  Agencies such as TCA in Orange County, California, have constructed 
plaza buildings on both sides of the overall plaza (i.e., right side of each directional 
conventional plaza).  This approach eliminates the need for a tunnel or overhead walkway 
if safety procedures are strictly followed by the attendants. Furthermore, these buildings 
can be designed for easy demolition in conjunction with future conversion to an ORT 
facility once ETC participation reaches a pre-established threshold.   
 
Vehicle access to the administration building requires a paved access way that intersects 
with the departure zone pavement.  
 
Operations staff walk from the administration building to their assigned toll booth either 
by walking across the toll islands and lanes, or through a tunnel (traditional approach) or 
overhead walkway (more recent approach).   
 
The survey results indicated most toll operators provide grade-separated crossings for 
operations staff.  These crossings are located either over or under retrofitted ETC 
dedicated lanes.  Plaza observations indicate ETC customers rarely stop as they drive 
through any toll lane with ETC capability, particularly if they know their account will only 
be charged the toll amount if the transponder is not read in the lane, pursuant to the 
agency’s business rules for handling ETC customer violations when traveling in a vehicle 
that is listed with their profile information. Multi-mode lane capability can provide an 
agency limited control in the way the plaza lanes are configured. 
2.7.2 Survey Results 
 
Administration Building Configuration and Access way  
Majority of toll plazas are configured such that the buildings and access way(s) are located 
downstream and to the right of a directional plaza. 
 
Toll Personnel Access Across ETC Dedicated Lanes 
About three quarters of the survey toll road responders do not require toll collectors to 
walk across ETC dedicated lanes, but most bridge operators do require this.

 2.7.4 Recommended Guidelines 
 
Administration Building and Access way Location Design Issues and Guideline 
Development-The location of an administration building depends on the implementation 
of express lanes, the location of ETC dedicated lanes, and existence or plans for a tunnel 
or overhead walkway.  If express lanes are part of initial construction or planned for the 
future, either a single or dual administration building should be located beyond the far 
outside pavement on either one or both sides.  If a tunnel or overhead walkway is not 
designed nor planned, two buildings are required and any ETC dedicated lanes must be 
located to the far left of the conventional plaza.  If a tunnel or overhead walkway is 
designed or planned, there are no restrictions on lane placement within the conventional 
plaza.     
 
The vehicle access way to the building should always be located downstream of the 
conventional plaza to avoid blockages by the adjacent lane queues and disrupting traffic 
flow.  The metering affect of a manual lane provides the gaps needed for right-in and 
right-out movements.  Making provisions for vehicle access to an administration building 
located in the center of a plaza precludes the placement of ETC dedicated lanes to the far 
left because of safety considerations. Consequently, any ETC dedicated lanes must be 
placed in the center of the directional conventional plaza, and either automatic or manual 
lanes must be placed on the left. Again, the access way must be located within the 
departure zone, downstream of the plaza. The intersection is a left-in and left-out 
movement. 
 
Safe staff access to the building parking area, and then to the toll booths, is an important 
design element feature. Specifically, operations staff should never need to cross an ETC 
dedicated lane to reach their assigned toll booth. Unless the ETC dedicated lanes are 
located to the far left of a conventional plaza, a tunnel or overhead walkway is required 
for toll booth access by the operations staff. Preferably, tunnel or overhead walkway 
access is provided even when ETC is implemented in the conventional plaza to only 
supplement manual and automatic collection (i.e., no ETC dedicated lanes).  If the 
operations staff is allowed to cross multi-mode lanes with ETC capability, the toll island 
should include lane passage constraints to highlight staff to a hazardous condition. This is 
a significant departure from the days when all toll collection was stop-and-go, resulting in 
considerably less risk to the toll collector when crossing toll lanes.  Furthermore, for new 
conventional plaza construction, toll island access to either an overhead walkway or 
tunnel should be spaced to require crossing only one toll lane (i.e., access every third toll 
island).

CHAPTER 3 
 
SIGNING, MARKINGS AND CHANNELIZATION 
The growth in electronic toll collection (ETC) transactions at toll plazas in this country has 
resulted in an increase of speed differentials within the plaza approach and departure areas. 
In addition, since the operational characteristics of ETC technology are vastly different 
than traditional cash collection (e.g., manual and automatic) the toll road operator must 
configure the plaza to maximize safety and efficiency so the user can quickly unravel the 
added complexities.  This complexity breeds increased driver confusion and erratic 
maneuvers within a plaza.  These conditions combine to result in a reduction in safety with 
a coincident effect on operational performance. 
 
Historically, toll plazas have been prone to sudden stops and lane changes as well as unsafe 
approach and departure speeds, particularly in an environment of merging, diverging and 
queuing vehicles that effectively increases the probability of a collision.  With just two 
methods of collection, manual and exact change automatic coin machines (ACM), 
problems still pervade toll plazas with incorrect lane selection and the resulting unsafe 
stops and maneuvers to change lanes.  The addition of ETC in manual and ACM lanes 
tends to increase this confusion.  When ETC dedicated lanes are deployed in conjunction 
with these conventional lane types, differential speed and driver expectations for high 
speed, non-stop performance compounds the problems encountered in manual and 
automatic lane plazas. 
 
Toll plazas with express lanes typically separate ETC customers from the conventional 
plaza upstream of the plaza, and either use the continuation of the mainline lanes or 
channelize the ETC customers into non-stop express lanes that diverge from the mainline 
lanes using an AASHTO compliant alignment.  Dedicated ETC lane plazas (where a non-
stop dedicated ETC lane is provided in the conventional plaza) present special challenges 
due to the mixing of non-stop vehicles and cash customers who are required to stop to pay 
tolls at the plaza.  The diverging, weaving and merging both upstream and downstream of 
conventional toll plaza can be minimized significantly through the use of advance signing, 
provided lanes serving each payment type are grouped together.  Conventional plazas with 
ETC dedicated lanes that vary the location (grouped to the far left, far right, and center, or 
alternated ETC dedicated and cash lanes) among plazas are inherently difficult to sign as 
well as engender a “user familiarity” in advance of the plaza.  
 
The following sections deal individually with the following issues: 
· The spacing of advance signing for express lanes and conventional plazas; 
· Advance signing message/sign content for express lanes and conventional plazas; 
· Canopy signing for conventional plazas; 
· Toll lane signing; 
· Speed control/mitigation through conventional plaza lanes;

The MUTCD recommends that advance guide signing for major/intermediate freeway 
interchanges be provided at distances of 2, 1 and ½ mile from the interchange.  The 
advance sign at the 2-mile distance is optional, but recommended.  For minor interchanges, 
the MUTCD requires advance signs at 1 and ½ mile distances from the interchange.  In 
addition, the MUTCD recommends placing signs overhead when three or more mainline 
lanes exist in one direction, or at complex interchanges. 
 
The MUTCD (Section 2C.06) also provides guidance for the placement of warning signs in 
advance of an obstacle or required maneuver by the driver.  Table 3.1, (excerpted from the 
MUTCD), provides advance sign placement distances based on the posted/operating speed 
of the roadway, and the speed reduction (or stop condition) that the vehicle is required to 
attain. The guidance (minimum advance sign placement distance) provided in this section is 
based on the time required for sign information processing, driver recognition, present 
speed and to allow a lane change maneuver.  This guidance may be applied to determine 
the following:  the minimum advance placement distance of signs for the divergence of the 
conventional toll plaza from the express lanes that typically follow the roadway mainline 
alignment; and, the minimum advance placement distance of the last advance sign before 
the toll plaza.  The advance sign placement distances should, however, be recalculated 
using higher Perception-Interpretation-Emotion-Volition (PIEV) times to account for 
possible complex weaving and lane changing maneuvers inherent to toll plazas.  In 
addition, the location of the last advance sign should be selected to ensure canopy signing 
and lane control signals are not obstructed.

3.1.2 Survey Results 
 
Tables 3.2 and 3.3 summarize the spacing of advance signing for express lanes and 
conventional plazas. Information on the survey methodology used to obtain the results 
presented below can be found in Subsection 1.4.2.  As shown in the tables pertaining to toll 
roads, the distance of the first (furthest) sign in advance of the toll plaza varies from ½ to 2 
miles for plazas with express lanes, while the first sign for conventional plazas is placed 
approximately 3/8” to 1 ¼ miles from the plaza.  Of the nine Toll Road agencies, all 
provided a minimum of 2 advance signs for plazas with express lanes, while six agencies 
provided 3 advance signs.  Only one toll bridge agency provided express lanes, with the 
first sign being placed approximately 1,000 feet (0.2 miles) in advance of the plaza.

State of the Practice and Recommendations 
       on Traffic Control Strategies at Toll Plazas 
Of seven responding toll bridge agencies, four agencies installed 3 advance signs for 
conventional toll plazas with ETC dedicated lanes, while two agencies installed 2 advance 
signs.  Only one of the toll bridge agencies installed only one sign in advance of the 
dedicated ETC toll plaza. 
 
3.1.3     Expert Panel Workshop Recommendations 
 
Express Lanes  
 
The Expert Panel recommended providing toll plaza advance signs at distances of 
approximately 2, 1 and ½ mile from the point at which the mainline lanes diverge resulting 
in express lanes and conventional plaza lanes, typically located to the right of the express 
lanes. Although Tables 3.4 and 3.5 require advance sign placement at approximately 2 miles 
upstream from the reference point, after further analysis this sign placement was deemed 
optional because of implementation difficulty, particularly for ramp, tunnel and bridge 
plazas.  This sign is commonly used to provide advance notice of a toll plaza the driver is 
approaching, such as “Toll Plaza Ahead 2 Miles”.  
 
The panel recommended the advance sign located 2 miles from the divergence point be 
placed overhead.  However, this sign could be installed as a roadside ground-mounted sign.  
The 1 and ½ mile signs were also recommended to be placed overhead.  The distances of 
2, 1 and ½ mile were chosen as desirable locations, although local conditions would dictate 
the specific placement distance of these signs from the divergence point.  In addition, the 
panel recommended provisions for toll rate information on the 2, 1 and ½ mile signs be 
considered optional. 
 
At the gore (i.e. the divergence point of express and conventional plaza lanes), it was 
recommended that overhead signs be installed. These signs would indicate the payment 
methods accepted and vehicle restriction information in the express lanes and conventional 
plaza lanes.  
 
It should be noted that the expert panel recommendations are specific to mainline plazas. 
Out of necessity advance signing for ramp plazas may involve less discrete advance signing 
locations because of limited ramp length. Signs providing notification of an approaching 
exit plaza for a closed ticket system are the sign types that can be eliminated with little or 
no expected impact on operational performance. 
 
Conventional Plazas 
 
For the conventional plaza, the Expert Panel recommended providing toll plaza advance 
signs at distances of approximately 2, 1 and ½ mile from the plaza.  On the 2 mile sign, the 
panel recommended including messages warning of the toll plaza ahead, with optional toll 
rate information. To minimize confusion, the lanes in conventional plaza should be 
grouped by accepted payment type, e.g. “Automatic Lanes”,  “Manual Lanes”, “Exact 
Change Cars Only”, “Changes Receipts All Vehicles”) for display on signs at the 
divergence points.  Overhead sign placement was preferred, although ground-mounted

roadside signs could be used instead.  The plaza centerline was considered the baseline for 
measuring distances for sign placement at the conventional plaza while the survey used the 
front edge of the canopy because it represented the closest possible placement for an 
overhead sign to be visible to approaching traffic and is independent of the canopy 
dimensions.  
 
The recommended placement of the 1 and 1/2 mile signs is overhead, with sign content 
composed of messages warning of a toll plaza ahead, the payment methods accepted, 
vehicle restrictions, and toll rate information as an option. 
 
The panel recommended a sign be placed a minimum of 800 feet from the canopy that 
provides information on payment methods accepted at the plaza lanes.  This distance was 
selected to ensure that the sign did not obstruct plaza canopy signing and lane use signals.   
 
An optional sign was also proposed at a distance of ¼ mile from the plaza canopy that 
provides payment method/lane type information, and lane-speed restrictions.  Payment 
methods/lane type and lane-speed restrictions messages are optional.     
 
Detailed toll rate information was recommended to be provided only on a toll schedule 
sign, placed close to the plaza.  The optional toll rate information on the 2, 1 and ½ mile 
signs should only be provided as brief messages for the highest volume vehicle type, with 
detailed toll rate information provided on a separate toll schedule sign.

Advance Toll Plaza Signing Guidelines 
 
The following guidelines are provided based on the preceding discussion. 
Guideline Advance Toll Plaza Signing Guideline 1 
Title Sign Spacing and Location – Express lanes 
Text Provide advance signs at approximately 1 and ½ miles in advance of 
the divergence of mainline express lanes (or some subset of the 
mainline lanes) from the conventional plaza lanes similar to 
interchange guide sign spacing.  Where the conventional plaza offers 
multiple payment types, an overhead sign should be installed 
approximately 800 feet from the canopy to provide guidance on the 
payment types available in the toll lanes ahead. 
Commentary It may not be possible to meet this guideline due to geometric 
constraints, but a minimum of two signs at 1 and ½ mile from the 
conventional plaza lane divergence should be provided.  After further 
analysis, an advance sign at approximately 2 miles from the stated 
reference point is considered optional, contrary to Table 3.4. The 
location of these signs should be determined based on field conditions 
to maximize their contribution to plaza operational performance and 
safety. 
Guideline Advance Toll Plaza Signing Guideline 2 
Title Sign Spacing and Location – Express lanes 
Text Provide a bridge structure with a sign array at the divergence of 
conventional plaza from the express lanes that continue on the 
roadway mainline alignment to display allowed payment types, vehicle 
restrictions and lane-use guidance. 
Commentary None 
Guideline Advance Toll Plaza Signing Guideline 3 
Title Lettering and letter-spacing 
Text Standard letter heights and letter-spacing in the FHWA’s MUTCD 
and Standard Highway Signs Book should be used in designing toll plaza 
sign messages at a minimum, with increased letter height desired to 
increase sign legibility in the vicinity of toll plazas. 
Commentary Complex driver maneuvers in the vicinity of toll plazas require 
increased sign legibility to enhance sign comprehension.

3.2 CANOPY TOLL SIGNING 
 
Toll plaza canopy signing is primarily used to indicate which payment type(s) are accepted 
in the lanes.  In addition, the front fascia panel or underside of the canopy is often used to 
mount a lane use signal consisting of a red “X” or a green downward pointing arrow to 
indicate the operational status of the lane (i.e., open or closed). Subsection 3.5 provides 
more detailed information on lane use signals.  For agencies using a fixed, static sign panel 
above automatic lanes, the canopy signing may include the toll rate for two axle vehicles in 
addition to payment methods accepted. Both fixed panel static signs and changeable 
message signs (CMS) are used to display the payment methods supported by the toll lane.  
The capability of changing the payment methods available (e.g., “Exact Change – ETC”, 
“Exact Change Only”) in a particular lane requires the deployment of a CMS.   
 
3.2.1 State-of-the-Practice 
 
Fixed panel static signs are in predominant use, although several agencies have used 
changeable message signs when the lane is multi-mode or equipped for multiple payment 
types (e.g., “Change – Receipts”, “Exact Change” and “E-ZPass Only”), thereby allowing 
lane operation changes based on traffic demand and equipment operational status.  A 
changeable message sign can also be used to display the current operation state of the lane, 
using both text (“Lane Closed”) and a symbol (red “X”). Flashing beacons or warning 
lights are often installed on both sides above or below the canopy sign to distinguish non-
stop ETC dedicated lanes within the conventional toll plaza.  The flashing lights are visible 
well before the canopy signs become legible so the ETC user has more time to maneuver 
to get into the correct lane. In addition, some agencies as part of their ETC retrofit have 
installed small, separate sign panels displaying the agency’s ETC logo above the manual and 
automatic lanes to indicate the lane is equipped to support ETC.  Where lane payment 
types are not changed and toll lanes supporting the same payment types are grouped 
together, the use of fixed, static sign panels with a unique background color have proved to 
be very effective in improving operational efficiency for toll roads such as the New York 
State Thruway and the Harris County Expressway  (See Exhibits 3-4 and 3-5).

3.2.4 Canopy Signing Design Issues and Guideline Development 
 
For conventional plaza lanes capable of multiple methods of collection (e.g., ETC, manual 
and automatic), deployment of a CMS can result in user confusion if the available 
collection modes are not consistently applied over extended time periods. Driver 
expectancy resulting from a consistent schedule of signing messages should preclude a 
reduction in safety and operational efficiency when using a CMS to change the collection 
mode(s) available in a toll lane.  
 
To maintain safety and operational efficiency as well as reduce weaving, the location of 
permanent ETC dedicated lanes within a conventional plaza should be uniquely 
distinguished to approaching customers in advance of the queue zone.  This can be 
accomplished by using flashing beacons mounted adjacent to the sides of the signs or 
below the sign. This is particularly relevant to non-barrier protected dedicated lanes within 
a conventional toll plaza. Past experience of the New York State Thruway indicates 
mounting the flashing beacons at the bottom of the sign is more effective in distinguishing 
the ETC dedicated lanes to customers positioned at a wider range of distances from the 
canopy.  Flashing beacons can be used as a hazard warning device to notify users where the 
higher speed, non-stop ETC dedicated lanes are located when approaching a conventional 
toll plaza.  This is considered consistent with the general intent of the MUTCD. 
 
Canopy Signing Guidelines 
 
 
 
Guideline Canopy Signing Design Guideline 1 
Title Canopy Signs 
Text Plazas offering lanes with multiple payment types and services should 
include canopy signing centered above each lane to indicate the 
payment type and service supported. Lanes supporting the same 
payment type(s) should be grouped together and use the same 
background color for the fixed, static sign panel. Lane use signals 
should be installed above each conventional plaza lane to display the 
operating status (i.e., open or closed) of each toll lane that is visible 
from the start of the queue zone, as a minimum. 
Commentary Information to be provided on canopy signing may include payment 
types accepted (i.e., ETC, exact change/tokens, or change & receipts), 
and vehicle restrictions (e.g., cars only, trucks only, cars and trucks). A 
CMS is required to provide the flexibility of changing the payment type
(s) supported by the lane and the lane status, thereby eliminating the 
need for a separate lane use signal.

3.3 TOLL LANE SIGNING  
 
Toll lane signing is used to guide and direct traffic through a toll lane from approximately 
the beginning of the impact attenuator or front edge of the toll island to the far end of 
the toll island.  A variety of different signs have been adopted by toll agencies to 
accomplish this objective, including changeable message and blankout signs, in addition 
to the standard fixed panel, static signs, both with and without a variable display module.  
Changeable message signs or combination fixed and variable display module signs are 
predominately used to control speed through the lane by providing feedback on the 
user’s speed approaching the toll collection point.  When considering the deployment of 
various toll lane signs, the desire to improve operational flow and safety along with 
discouraging violations needs to be tempered with user overload and toll island clutter 
resulting in user confusion. 
 
3.3.1 State-of-the-Practice 
 
Over the years there has been a noticeable trend in conventional plaza lanes of less toll 
lane signing with the likely intent to reduce user confusion.   A sign that can be found in 
the majority of conventional toll plaza cash lanes is the stop sign. The survey data 
indicates that 51% of the agencies responding have deployed stop signs in cash lanes.  
The expert panel discussed the use of stop signs, particularly the modified versions that 
have been installed in manual and automatic (i.e., exact change) toll lanes.  Examples of 
modified stop signs, defined as those containing supplemental messages such as “Pay 
Toll” and “Take Ticket”, were reviewed.  Some panelists reasoned the limited space to 
install visible signing on the islands had necessitated placing supplemental messages on 
the Stop signs.  No consensus recommendation was reached on the use of the modified 
stop signs along the toll lanes.  However, the panel did see merit in a new section of the 
MUTCD specifying a modified stop sign that included supplemental messages such as 
“Pay Toll” or “Take Ticket”.  This new sign would be restricted for use only at toll 
plazas.  Alternatively and in the interest of preserving the integrity of the stop sign, a 
plaque could be mounted beneath the standard stop sign to provide supplemental 
information.  The panel also discussed one agency’s practice of using a rectangular sign 
with the message “Stop Pay Toll” using black letters on a white background.  This 
application was viewed as being contrary to uniformity and familiarity engendered by the 
MUTCD and was rejected. 
 
With the proliferation of electronic toll collection (ETC) in all toll lanes, the installation 
of speed limit signs in the conventional plaza lanes, specifically the permanent ETC 
dedicated lanes, has become more prevalent. After adjusting for outliers, the survey data 
finds a considerable range in posted speeds through a dedicated lane, ranging from 5 
mph to 45 mph.  While it is understandable for agencies to be concerned with the safety 
of their staff and customers, posting a speed significantly below the average 85% 
percentile speed without a rigorous enforcement regimen will result in little compliance 
based on field observations conducted on the Illinois Tollway in conjunction with testing 
the effectiveness of speed display signs.  In a 1998 study, speed display boards installed 
along local streets and arterials were found to be effective.  The study also revealed that

       on Traffic Control Strategies at Toll Plazas 
all speed control devices produced more significant results on speeds of 10 mph or more 
over the 25-mph speed limit.1   Consequently, speed display signs can only be viewed as 
one element of a group of factors designed to both control and minimize the consequences 
of higher speeds in the dedicated lanes.  For the manual lanes, the survey data indicates that 
only 23% of the responding agencies have installed speed limit signs. While use of a speed 
limit sign in a multi-payment type lane that also has a “stop pay toll” sign is likely to cause 
confusion and should be avoided, the ETC user cannot always be expected to stop if the 
traffic signal turns green prior to passing the tollbooth door or ACM/ATIM.   
 
This becomes more complicated for multi-payment type lanes that are operated as ETC 
dedicated lanes, commonly when commuter traffic is heavy.  In these lanes a speed limit 
sign without a “stop pay toll” sign should be deployed to provide some measure of 
attendant protection in crossing the lane, but needs to be supplemented with other 
measures.  To this end, as described above, some agencies have implemented speed display 
signs on the approach end of the toll island to show the user’s speed, typically measured by 
radar sensors, in conjunction with the posted speed limit.  Either MUTCD compliant signs 
commonly installed along local streets and arterials or LED signs similar to displays 
deployed at roadway construction sites are used to show the driver’s speed.   The survey 
data indicates agencies are more likely to deploy these signs in the ETC dedicated lanes 
than in the cash lanes, suggesting the dedicated lanes are experiencing more problems with 
excessive speeds. However, the lanes the attendant must cross should be afforded the 
highest priority when considering the use of these signs.  
 
Other signs that have been used in conventional toll plazas include “No Stopping” (Do 
Not Stop) in the ETC dedicated lanes, “Stay in Vehicle” in the ACM/ATIM lanes, 
“Enforcement by Video” or a related camera based enforcement message in lanes 
deploying violation enforcement system (VES) equipment, and “Wait for Green” attached 
to the island traffic signal pole in the cash lanes.  The toll island location of some of these 
signs is shown on the toll plaza diagram below and in the Glossary.

3.3.4   Applicability to MUTCD 
 
The MUTCD provides the framework for toll lane signing, upon which agencies have 
made modifications to better relate the toll collection aspects with guidance and control of 
traffic flow through the lane.  The stop sign used in a toll plaza                                                              
environment often attempts to combine the MUTCD regulatory function with the legal 
obligation to pay the indicated toll or to take a ticket representing an official record of entry 
into the System.    
 
3.3.5 Recommended Guidelines 
Toll Lane Signing Design Issues 
 
· While the implementation of ETC in cash (i.e., manual and automatic) lanes has not 
diminished the desires of the agencies to have all traffic stop at either the tollbooth or 
ACM, a user with a transponder is more likely to focus on the island traffic signal than 
the stop sign with the expectation of a successful read. Consequently, a problem with 
the transponder or ETC account unbeknownst to the user is likely to result in the 
vehicle being beyond the stopping location for paying the attendant or depositing coins

· The location of the toll lane signing must be selected to assure visibility to approaching 
passenger car and truck traffic, spaced along the toll island to avoid overloading the 
user with information, and installed adjacent to any equipment to which the sign 
specifically relates.  The location of toll lane signing is constrained by physical features 
of the toll island, such as the size of tollbooth and columns supporting the canopy as 
well as the length of the toll island. 
 
· Adequate horizontal clearance from the vertical face of the toll island or raised barrier 
must be provided to avoid damage from passing vehicles. 
 
· The less frequent or new user of an agency’s toll facilities can benefit from some of the 
following signs that have been deployed: “No Stopping” (“Do Not Stop”) in the ETC 
dedicated lanes, “Stay in Vehicle” in the ACM/ATIM lanes, “Enforcement by Video” 
or a related camera based enforcement message in lanes deploying VES equipment, 
and “Wait for Green” attached to the island traffic signal pole in the cash lanes.  The 
problem each of these signs is attempting to address varies from region to region, and 
the severity may not warrant deployment of these particular signs. 
 
Toll Lane Signing Guideline Development: 
 
· Although use of the toll industry standard modified stop sign stating “Stop Pay Toll” 
may not be afforded the same level of compliance among ETC accountholders, 
deployment of this sign in the cash lanes should continue to reinforce the user’s 
statutory responsibility to pay the indicated toll.   This applies equally to the “Stop 
Take Ticket” sign commonly deployed in the ATIM lanes of a closed ticket system.   
Users of a ticket system, including those without a valid transponder or ETC account, 
are given reasonable notice to initiate a toll transaction at their entry location by taking 
a ticket to avoid payment of a toll based on the furthest entry point from their exit 
location. 
 
· The location of toll lane signing on the toll island must be selected to result in the user 
consistently responding at the intended location along the lane. Speed limit signs need 
to be installed at the approach end to the toll island with the expectation that the user 
will adjust their speed to comply with the speed limit when traveling through the lane.  
If speed display signing is deployed, it should be located in conjunction with a speed 
limit sign to elicit a quicker response from the user to comply by reducing the vehicle’s 
speed as needed when traveling through the lane.  The modified stop sign commonly 
used by the agencies should be installed at the approach end of the tollbooth in the 
manual lanes.  For the automatic lanes, the modified stop sign should be installed on 
the toll island prior to the ACM or ATIM, mounted to a canopy column or other 
physical feature, if available.  For multi-payment type lanes that are operated in an ETC 
only mode, a speed limit sign should be installed in the lane, particularly when a 
collector must cross these lanes to access their assigned tollbooth. In this case, an ETC 
in the ACM. If the traffic signal remains red, the user may make an ill-advised and 
unsafe decision to back-up their vehicle to pay the toll.

user complying with the “Stop Pay Toll” sign may be inclined to quickly accelerate 
from the booth or machine when exiting, which is where the collector typically crosses 
the lanes.  Signing related to equipment installed on the toll island should be attached 
to or installed adjacent to that equipment. Any “No Stopping” signs should be installed 
in an ETC dedicated lane prior to where the user recognizes there are no provisions 
for cash payment in the lane.  The “Stay in Vehicle” sign should be installed above the 
ACM or ATIM.  The selected location of these signs must assure visibility to all 
passenger car and trucks allowed to use the particular lane. The diagram at the end of 
this section shows the location of some of the signs described above. 
 
· With an assumed window of 6-18 inches representing a conservative range for 
horizontal clearance from the travelway used within the toll industry, 12 inches 
provides an appropriate minimum clearance for protecting toll lane signing from 
extended mirrors and objects or materials extending beyond the side of a vehicle.  The 
AASHTO “Green Book” guidelines specify 18 inch clearance to an obstacle on an 
urban arterial with curbs where speeds are expected to be higher and lanes are not 
physically separated. 
 
· Before adding toll lane signing such as “No Stopping” in the ETC dedicated lanes, 
“Stay in Vehicle” in the ACM/ATIM lanes, “Enforcement by Video” or a related 
camera based enforcement message in lanes deploying VES equipment, and “Wait for 
Green”, the agency should make an assessment of the magnitude of the problem the 
particular sign is intended to address along with the particular user benefit derived 
from the sign.

3.4 SPEED CONTROL/MITIGATION 
 
Speed reduction of all traffic approaching a conventional plaza after divergence with any 
express lanes has been a prime concern for toll agencies.  With the increasing use of ETC 
technologies within the conventional plaza, particularly ETC dedicated lanes, there is 
greater concern for vehicles approaching and departing at excessive speeds resulting in 
speed differentials with adjacent users that stop to pay the indicated toll or to take a ticket. 
Although there is less maneuvering on the departure side than the approach side of a 
conventional plaza, variation in the acceleration performance of different vehicles and 
types/classes of vehicles complicates the merging of vehicles as lanes reduce to the available 
continuous mainline lanes.  The speed attained after leaving the plaza should match the 
prevailing mainline travel speed when merging, which may be prevented when following slower 
moving trucks. 
 
3.4.1 State-of-the-Practice 
 
To reduce vehicle speed approaching a toll plaza, agencies have used a varied application of 
advance speed warning signs, pavement markings, channelization devices, raised pavement 
markers (e.g., turtles) and speed bumps, in addition to posting speed limit signs.  For 
express and ETC dedicated lanes, speed enforcement by the state patrol or other authorized 
law enforcement personnel is deployed to varying degrees amongst toll agencies. This 
strategy requires sufficiently wide shoulders or a widened pull-off area downstream or 
upstream of the tolling point.   For the departure side of the conventional plaza, the 
strategy used by the majority of agencies is to use signs to request trucks and possibly buses 
and RVs stay in the right lane to minimize the affect on other traffic in attaining the 
mainline prevailing speed. The randomness of the toll transaction time in the cash lanes 
provides an inherent metering affect that tends to relieve merging conflicts.

3.4.3 Recommended Guidelines 
 
Speed Control/Mitigation Design Issues and Guideline Development 
 
· In addition to providing time savings and better safety performance, toll roads must 
distinguish themselves from freeways by providing customer service. The use of raised 
pavement materials to reduce speed is uncomfortable to the vehicle passengers and 
may cause damage to the vehicle.  For this reason, the use of in-pavement materials to 
reduce speed when approaching a conventional plaza lane should be avoided and 
alternatives should be investigated for plazas that currently use this method of speed 
control.

       on Traffic Control Strategies at Toll Plazas 
· The acceleration performance of trucks is clearly less than passenger cars, with some 
rare exceptions.  Given manual lanes are normally located on the right side of the con-
ventional plaza, the use of signs to require trucks and possibly buses and RVs to use 
the right lanes and stay to the right when departing the plaza provides a strategy with 
an expected high benefit/cost ratio.  The effectiveness of this strategy is dependent on 
the cooperation of the truck or bus drivers, who may believe the value of their time 
allows them to use any lane or path when departing the plaza. However, this attitude is 
expected to be in the minority. 
 
3.4.4 Speed Control/Mitigation Guidelines 
Guideline Speed Control/Mitigation Guideline 1 
Title Approach Speed Reduction 
Text Speed bumps, turtles or other raised in-pavement materials should not 
be used to reduce vehicle speed before entering a conventional plaza 
toll lane. 
Commentary This recommendation is not intended to preclude or discourage the 
use of rumble strips (slotted or raised thermoplastic) used to warn 
drivers veering out of a travel lane. 
Guideline Speed Control/Mitigation Guideline 2 
Title Departure Speed Control 
Text Signs should be placed to require trucks using cash lanes located to the 
right of the conventional plaza to use the right lane/ stay to the right 
when departing the plaza. 
Commentary This strategy may not be feasible when the length of the approach 
zone and queue zone is inadequate for trucks to safely merge to the 
right.  Furthermore, manual lanes may not be located to the far right of 
the plaza, which primarily applies to ramp toll plazas being fed traffic 
from two directions.

Lane-use signals are devices commonly mounted to the fascia or front edge of the canopy, 
centered over a toll lane, and used to indicate an open or closed lane operating status.  One 
of the two types of signals most commonly installed in toll plazas use a red “X” for closed 
and green “?” for open. These symbols are primarily formed from LEDs and fabricated as 
part of a rectangular environmental enclosure or part of a multi-line changeable message 
sign that is also used to display methods of payment supported by the installed lane 
equipment. The other commonly used signal is horizontally aligned red and green traffic 
signal heads. 
 
3.5.1  State-of-the-Practice 
 
Lane-use signals within the tolling industry are not as standardized in appearance and 
function as other equipment and devices used along or within the toll lane, such as the ITS, 
ACM, and loop detector.  However, the simplicity and clarity of the message these devices 
are intended to display allows variation in design that is expected to result in minimal user 
confusion. 
 
Conventional lane-use signals are specially fabricated overhead displays/signals that permit 
or prohibit the use of specific lanes.    The two types of lane-use signals used most often by 
toll agencies are distinguished by their shapes and symbols.  The rectangular fabricated 
signs typically display either an arrow or an ‘X’, using green and red colors, respectively. A 
variation to this scheme is shown in Exhibit 3.6, where a third state, flashing concentric 
yellow circles, is used when the lane is operated as a dedicated ETC lane. The other type of 
lane-use signal deployed above conventional plaza lanes is the traditional signal heads 
similar to those used at signalized intersections on arterials, with the signal heads positioned 
in a horizontal alignment.   
 
From the survey responses, approximately 60% of toll agencies use lane-use signals 
consisting of traditional signal heads positioned horizontally.  Sizes of the two primary lane 
use signals deployed today vary, with lane-use signal display panels ranging between 14 and 
42 inches high, and signal heads ranging from 8 to 12 inch diameter are predominantly 
used.  Although square display panel configurations are most common, rectangular displays 
are also being used by some agencies.

3.5.3 Applicability to MUTCD 
 
The MUTCD 2003 only mention of toll collection applications related to lane-use signals, 
states that: “Lane-use signals may be used for reversible-lane operations at toll booths.  
They may also be used if there is no intent or need to reverse lanes”.   
 
3.5.4 Recommended Guidelines 
 
Lane-use Signal Design Issues 
 
Location of the lane-use signal above the respective toll lanes must be selected to be 
clearly visible to approaching traffic well in advance of the toll lane and complement the 
lane status sign providing information on payment types supported in the lane.   
· Vertical clearance and uniformity of signal location for each plaza must be 
maintained.  
· Consistency with existing standard practices for roadway, bridge and tunnel designs, 
particularly for symbol type and display colors. 
· Selection of conventional signal heads in lieu of arrow and “X” symbols needs to be 
considered from a user familiarity prospective that may have already been established 
from lane-use signal deployments on other facilities (both tolled and freeway) within 
a metropolitan statistical area or other defined region. 
· From a safety perspective, color blind users will be considerably more likely to 
correctly interpret the arrow and “X” display than the traffic signal. 
· Expended man-hours and lane closures to maintain each of the two signal types must 
be considered when selecting between traffic signal heads and customized displays. 
· Spares and parts inventory must be assessed to avoid full unit replacement before the 
device reaches its useful life. 
 
 
Lane-use Signal Guideline Development 
 
· Location and mounting of lane-use signals should be centered above each 
conventional plaza toll lane and attached to the canopy fascia below the lane status 
sign or supported from the underside of canopy, respectively.  Alternatively, lane use 
signals can be mounted to a gantry or bridge structure located immediately in front of 
the canopy.  A minimum vertical clearance of seventeen feet (17’) should be 
maintained based on national interstate bridge guidelines (AASHTO A Policy on 
Geometric Design of Highways and Streets).  To the maximum extent possible, the 
mounting needs to accommodate easy access to the power and communication 
interconnections and provide clearance for accessing internal components. 
 
· The lane-use signal should be designed as a larger version of the lane use signals 
specified by the MUTCD that are mounted overhead to gantries and bridge

structures and centered above roadway, bridge and tunnel travel lanes.  Provisions for 
consistency with these installations supports the recommended placement of the lane-
use signal below the canopy sign.  A red “X” should be displayed to indicate a closed 
state and a downward pointing green arrow should be displayed to indicate an open 
state. Lane –use signals should be visible from at least 600’ to allow users to make a 
timely decision on which lane to use for their transaction. 
 
· If lane-use signals are currently in use within the metropolitan statistical area or other 
defined region encompassing the toll facility, either adoption of this lane-use signal or 
coordination with the agency deploying the existing signals to consider adopting a new 
signal should be pursued.  Uniformity on a regional basis will assure user familiarity, 
which is expected to result in improved traffic flow.   
 
· Maintenance considerations of the two types of lane-use signals (i.e., horizontally 
aligned signal heads or combined arrow and “X” display panels) result in the 
recommended use of LED technology for both designs.  Use of incandescent light for 
the signal heads would require more frequent maintenance requiring capacity reducing 
lane closures, and thereby longer vehicle queues.  
 
· Spares and parts must be procured to assure continuous operation of the lane-use 
signals that displays critical information to the user in making a timely determination of 
lanes available for their desired transaction type.  This is expected to result in improved 
traffic flow.   
Guideline Lane-use Control Signals Design Guideline 1 
Title Signal Design 
Text Recommend use of MUTCD standard green arrow and red “X” 
design for lane-use signals in lieu of traditional signal heads. 
Commentary Use of traditional signal head may cause confusion, as the green and 
red signal head indications generally mean “go” and “stop”, not 
“open” and “closed”.  Color blindness of an expected small 
percentage of the users justifies the display from a safety perspective. 
Guideline Lane-use Control Signals Design Guideline 2 
Title  Lane-Use Signal Specifications 
Text Lane-use signal faces shall provide a minimum nominal height of 
450mm (18 in.) or 12” diameter, be visible from a minimum distance

3.6 CHANGEABLE MESSAGE SIGNING 
 
Changeable message signs (CMS) at conventional plazas are primarily used for providing 
lane collection mode information, allowing the agency the ability to change a particular 
lane, such as from attended to unattended in either a combined ETC and ACM mode, or 
just one of these two collection modes. Conversely, an ACM collection mode can be 
converted to an ETC dedicated lane during times of high ETC demand.  Flexibility in 
changing the collection mode of the lane allows better management of vehicle 
throughput and operational costs, although based on the survey data about half of the 
agencies are not taking advantage of this flexibility.  This lane type flexibility presumes 
the lanes are properly equipped and the physical features of the lane are conducive to safe 
travel in any of the selected collection modes.   Facilities that charge or are contemplating 
charging time of day pricing typically use variable display modules combined with fixed 
static sign panels to show the current toll for passenger cars and possibly other vehicle 
classifications.  Notwithstanding the above, CMS should only be deployed when multiple 
sign messages are required because of the significantly higher capital and operating costs 
incurred relative to a fixed static sign. 
 
3.6.1 State-of-the-Practice 
 
Agencies use changeable message signs over ETC dedicated, automatic (i.e., ACM and 
ATIM) and manual lanes. The survey data indicates the percentage usage of CMS in each 
of these lane types as follows: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The level of sophistication of the CMS installed at conventional plazas varies 
considerably.  Signs capable of from 1 to 3 lines of text are being used to display a lane’s 
collection mode.  The majority of CMS implementations use a character height of 10 or 
12 inches, making the signs visible from a distance of at least 500 feet.  The results of the 
survey data indicates that only half of the agencies are changing the lane collection mode 
messages displayed above the toll lane. This may be partly attributable to the physical 
characteristics of the toll lane or a consistent user demand throughout the day for a 
particular collection mode.

Some agencies have combined variable display modules with fixed, static signs to provide 
the capability to change a very limited portion of the complete sign message.  This 
approach is typically used by agencies that have implemented or are contemplating the 
implementation of time of day pricing, whereby the variable toll amount for a passenger car 
and possibly other vehicle classifications shown on the fixed, static portion of the sign is 
displayed.  With many regions of the country experiencing high traffic congestion, toll 
agencies and state departments of transportation are responding to the congestion and, in 
the case of existing toll facilities, the associated conventional plaza delays by planning and 
implementing variable priced express lanes for their facilities. To expand participation in 
the ETC Program, various discounts and incentives such as time of day pricing may be 
offered only to ETC users.  Depending on the method an agency chooses to convey 
pricing information, fixed static signs with variable display modules may be needed to 
display the current toll in effect to the ETC customers.

3.6.4 Applicability to MUTCD 
 
The MUTCD provides standards and guidance for the design of guide signs, from which a 
framework for multi-collection mode signing can be derived. Toll agencies have used this 
framework to make modifications to better relate toll collection aspects with guidance and 
control of traffic flow through a lane.  MUTCD committees have been active in setting 
guidelines and standards for the use of CMS along freeways, which have applicability to toll 
facilities.  Their efforts have resulted in proposed amendments to Chapter 2J addressing 
Changeable Message Signs.  
 
3.6.5 Recommended Guidelines 
CMS Design Issues 
· After years of evaluating the performance of CMS using fiber optic technology versus 
LED technology, LED has evolved as the preferred technology, largely because of the 
rapid advancement in LEDs that are used to comprise the sign messages. Fiber optic 
signs typically use a halogen light source that needs frequent replacement, even with 
recent technology advancements. A catwalk should be installed in conjunction with the 
CMS to accommodate access for maintenance without the need for lane closures. 
Alternatively, a bucket truck or lift platform can be used for CMS maintenance after 
closing the lane below. 
 
· Visibility under all ambient lighting and weather conditions supports the use a light 
based technology such as LED and fiber optic over a mechanical technology such as 
prism and flip disk. 
 
· Light based technology signs have significantly higher capital and operating expenses 
relative to mechanical technology signs.

State of the Practice and Recommendations 
       on Traffic Control Strategies at Toll Plazas 
· To achieve maximum visibility for approaching traffic, the CMS must be tilted toward 
the plaza pavement at the angle and height recommended by the manufacturer.  The 
CMS can be manufactured with the front face at the recommended angle and having a 
vertical backplane to reduce installation complexity. The color of the characters should 
be selected to comply with the MUTCD, while achieving maximum visibility. The 
height of the characters must be selected to be visible at a distance at least equal to the 
length of the queue zone.  The CMS needs to be centered over the toll lane.  
 
· CMS employing a light based technology should be capable of multiple brightness 
levels that are selected based on data inputs from multiple photocells attached to the 
top of the CMS.  
 
· The canopy structure must be structurally sound to support the weight of the CMS, 
catwalk and two maintenance technicians. 
 
CMS Guideline Development: 
 
· The advantages of CMS using a light based LED technology are now significant and 
should be deployed for all new installations. Design of the catwalk for maintenance 
service must assure sign visibility is not diminished by the presence of the catwalk as 
the user approaches the toll lane. The finish on the CMS cabinet (i.e., sides and back) 
needs to minimize the absorption of heat to reduce the cooling load on the CMS 
ventilation system and to prevent the cabinet surface temperature from exceeding a 
safe threshold for performing maintenance. The catwalk should be fabricated from 
low maintenance, non-corrosive materials. Grounding and lightning protection needs 
to be provided for the housing cabinet and copper power and communication lines. 
 
· If the manufacturer’s recommended tilt is not fabricated into the design of the cabinet, 
CMS support brackets must be securely attached to the canopy framing to achieve the 
recommended angle. The CMS should be visible for a distance at least equal to the 
depth of the queue zone plus an additional 40 - 50% approach factor.  The minimum 
height of the CMS letters when the speed limit is less than 55 mph should be 10.6 
inches,  and where the speed limit is 55 mph or greater, the minimum letter height 
should be 18 inches. 
 
· CMS employing a light based technology should be capable of a minimum of three 
levels of brightness that are based on data inputs from a minimum of three photocells.

3.7 PAVEMENT MARKINGS/CHANNELIZATION/IMPACT 
ATTENUATORS 
 
Several types of pavement markings can be found at toll plazas.  Pavement markings such 
as lane lines, gore striping, and transverse and diagonal lines are used by most agencies 
within their conventional plazas.  Specific applications vary, but are generally used for plaza 
zone definition, channelization and virtual plaza island extensions.  Pavement markings 
have also been used for lane guidance, indicating a particular primary collection mode (e.g., 
exact change, full service, attended, E-ZPass Only) within a lane channelized by pavement 
markings extending to an impact attenuator or chevron pavement markings immediately in 
front of the toll island.  
 
Lane channelization is used to direct vehicles in a particular direction.  It occurs before and 
after conventional plaza toll lanes, in both the queue and recovery zones, respectively.  
Express and ETC dedicated lanes require special lane striping and channelization 
techniques to minimize lane changes through the plaza.  
 
Pavement markings extending upstream from the front of a toll island require a quicker 
response by the user in selecting a lane to complete their transaction, but reduce the space 
available for unsafe maneuvering within the queue zone.  Pavement markings extending 
downstream from the rear of the toll island allow users more time to accelerate before 
merging with other customers prior to entering the mainline lanes.  
 
LED-illuminated in-pavement markers can provide direction and information to the driver 
directly from the road surface. A vendor supplied controller for these LED in-pavement 
markers can be integrated with a lane controller similar to lane status signals to provide lane 
guidance to approaching and departing traffic resulting in a more efficient and safe 
operation.  
 
Channelizing devices (i.e., delineators/pylons) extending a limited distance upstream from 
the front edge of the toll island or impact attenuator are used to separate plaza approach 
lanes.  Delineators/pylons provide the same channelization function as pavement markings 
described above.  Polycarbonate delineators/pylons are most commonly used, although 
traffic cones have also been used to delineate plaza approach lanes.  Traffic cones are 
predominately used to indicate a closed lane, particularly when the lane does not include a 
lane closure gate at the approach end of the toll island.  
 
Impact attenuators are installed in front of toll islands and the approach end of concrete 
barrier to absorb the energy of a colliding vehicle by collapsing upon its framework.  
Although various vendor designs are available, results of performance tests on their 
products reduces the number of potential selections.  A recommended list of approved 
vendors is often available from the state department of transportation.  References should 
also be checked to assess the experience of existing installations and to compare actual 
performance to claimed performance.

3.7.1 State-of-the-Practice 
 
Based on the survey results, for agencies using pavement markings in advance of the toll 
lanes within a conventional plaza, the tapered chevron and gore taper pattern are most 
commonly used.  Pavement markings provide the agencies with a means of effectively 
extending the toll lanes to require a more timely lane selection by the user while reducing 
the incident of maneuvering and lane changes within the plaza queue zone.  As stated 
above, pavement markings are also used by some agencies to indicate the collection mode 
in the toll lane at the end of the approach lane channelized by pavement markings. 
Pavement marking materials most frequently used, listed in the order of durability and 
highest cost are: preformed tape, thermoplastic coating, epoxy paint and reflective paint.  
Pavement marking colors other than white and yellow have been used to distinguish lanes, 
particularly ETC dedicated lanes.  For example, the ETC dedicated lanes on the New Jersey 
Turnpike use purple and white colored pavement markings to delineate the ETC express 
lanes.  As an example of lane guidance, TCA distinguishes ETC and cash lanes with 
pavement markings primarily for use when fog significantly reduces visibility of overhead 
signs. 
 
Impact attenuators have been installed by the many toll road agencies and to a lesser extent 
by toll bridge agencies at the front of the conventional plaza toll islands and barriers.  While 
an impact attenuator provides protection to the user when approaching any of the 
conventional plaza toll lanes, the manual toll island impact attenuators also provides critical 
protection for the attendant operating the tollbooth collection equipment. Even with mass 
concrete protection commonly constructed in conjunction with the island in front of the 
toll booth, a properly designed energy absorbing device offers additional protection, 
particularly in the case of errant trucks. The design length of the impact attenuator is based 
on the size and speed of vehicles the impact attenuator could encounter during its design 
life. The majority of impact attenuators installed are retractable, multi-sectional guardrails 
that increase resistance as the front sections of the attenuator collapse and move toward 
the island, usually on a track anchored to the pavement.  Other similar attenuator designs 
and associated materials have been used based on the same theory of operation.  Chapter 4 
of the Roadside Design Guide should be referenced for additional information on this 
topic.

3.7.3 Expert Panel Workshop Recommendations 
 
The panel only discussed pavement striping and channelization with respect to guiding 
drivers into the toll lanes and preventing last-minute lane changing.  The panel 
recommended the use of pavement striping and channelizing devices only for non-stop 
lanes.    This recommendation did not consider the benefits and appropriateness of “gore 
area” pavement markings used by many agencies to highlight toll islands and direct 
vehicles to both the left and right, as applicable.  
 
3.7.4 Recommended Guidelines 
 
Pavement Markings/Channelization/Impact Attenuators Design Issues 
and Guideline Development 
 
· The use of pavement markings to indicate the collection mode in the upstream toll 
lane can be covered over by a vehicle during a considerable portion of the peak hour 
periods. Attempts by the customers to read partially concealed pavement markings 
may result in increased plaza delays. Lane guidance overhead signing can be 
supplemented by placing pavement markings near the divergence of express lanes and 
conventional plaza, where a higher rate of interpretation is expected. However, 
accumulated snow and ice can render the markings unreadable.  Depending on the 
type of pavement marking material used, extensive use of pavement markings within a 
plaza will effectively raise the annual plaza maintenance budget.  Pavement markings 
may also reduce surface friction when the pavement is wet, thereby increasing the 
potential hazards of vehicles maneuvering to find the shortest queue.

· While pavement markings used to delineate lanes within the queue zone effectively 
reduce the space available for customers to maneuver their vehicles in search of the 
shortest queue length, a significant portion of these customers are expected to ignore 
the markings.  However, pavement markings used to distinguish reversible lanes should 
be used in conjunction with lane use signals to assure vehicles do not enter a reversible 
lane open to vehicle traveling in the opposite direction. 
 
· Pavement markings used to extend the physical separation of dedicated lanes from cash 
lanes should be double, 8 inch, white lines.  This is consistent with MUTCD’s 
recommendation for installing wide white lines where crossing is prohibited but without 
giving a specific width.  
 
· Only tall reflective traffic cones with a minimum height of 28 inches and a fluorescent 
collar should be used to close lanes to assure maximum visibility.  The nose of the 
impact attenuator must also be highly visible to approaching traffic for all lighting and 
weather conditions. As a minimum, cones used in closing a lane should be placed 
across the lane at the front edge of the impact attenuator or the toll island when there 
is no impact attenuator.  
Pavement Markings/Channelization/Impact Attenuators Guidelines 
Guideline Pavement Marking/Channelization/Impact Attenuator 
Guideline 1 
Title Toll Island/Attenuator Pavement Markings 
Text Gore or chevron pavement markings should be installed immediately 
in front of the impact attenuator, as applicable, or the toll island. 
Commentary While winter visibility and maintenance expenses are important 
considerations, the safety and operational benefits of reducing space 
for unsafe lane changes and maneuvering within the plaza and 
highlighting the areas of the plaza queue zone that do not lead to a toll 
lane justify the recommended pavement markings 
Guideline Pavement Marking/Channelization/Impact Attenuator 
Guideline 2 
Title Lane Separation using Pavement Marking 
Text Extension of physical separation of ETC dedicated lanes and cash 
lanes should be accomplished using double 8 inch wide pavement 
markings. 
Commentary Except for standard edge markings, use of pavement markings within 
the queue and recovery zones should be evaluated based on such 
factors as traffic patterns, weather conditions, delays caused by 
maintenance, and improvements to operational performance.

Guideline Pavement Marking/Channelization/Impact Attenuator 
Guideline 3 
Title Dedicated Lane Channelization 
Text Dedicated lanes within a conventional plaza should use both barrier 
and pavement markings that extend upstream to approximately the 
point where approaching vehicle speed to the cash lanes drops below 
30 mph during off peak hours. 
Commentary The 30 mph threshold is deemed to be a reasonable maximum speed 
through an ETC dedicated lane. Channelization is intended to prevent 
or discourage vehicles from attempting to enter a dedicated lane by 
unsafely crossing the cash lanes when the driver inadvertently failed to 
get into the proper lane  when approaching the plaza. 
Guideline Pavement Marking/Channelization/Impact Attenuator 
Guideline 4 
Title Toll Island/Impact Attenuator 
Text Impact attenuators/crash cushions should be installed at the approach 
end of all mainline plaza toll islands whenever the approach speed of 
vehicles can exceed 25 mph. 
Commentary For agencies to assure approach speeds do not exceed 25 mph, 
continuous rigorous enforcement using both enforcement personnel 
and speed detection devices in conjunction with a license plate capture 
system to issue high fines should be deployed.  Exhibit 3-8 shows the 
condition of a 1999 Volkswagen Passat after a front end collision with 
a stationary object when traveling at 35 miles per hour.  The damage 
shown should not be considered indicative of the damage sustained by 
other types of vehicles, which may be considerably more severe and 
therefore supports use of a lower threshold speed for deploying an 
attenuator. 
Guideline Pavement Marking/Channelization/Impact Attenuator 
Guideline 5 
Title Toll Island/Impact Attenuator 
Text Impact Attenuator/crash cushions for cash lanes should be designed 
for selected percent above the posted approach zone speed limit, plus 
5 mph. For existing plazas, this percentage should be determined from 
field studies. Each impact attenuator/crash cushion type has specific 
requirements relative to cross slopes, grades, curbs, etc.  Consequently, 
profile grades and cross slopes for new construction should be 
designed per the specification of the impact attenuator/crash cushion. 
Commentary Pavement markings offering warning to approaching motorists should 
be considered for placement immediately in front of the impact 
attenuator/crash cushions, in the form of a gore taper with diagonal 
striping or tapered chevrons.

3.8 DELINEATION 
 
Delineators/pylons are retro-reflective devices typically mounted above the roadway sur-
face and at continuous intervals along the side of the roadway to indicate alignment of the 
roadway.  Variants to the MUTCD defined delineators/pylons are commonly used in con-
ventional  plazas to channelize vehicles into a toll lane and prevent crossing into or out of a 
channelized lane or access way.  The more commonly used delineators/pylons installed to 
separate vehicles are tubular flexible stanchions that are anchored to the pavement using 
adhesives and or hardware. Pop-up delineators/pylons are also available and should be 
considered for use at plazas with reversible lanes.  Delineators/pylons used to define plaza 
alignment are commonly rigid and are anchored below the ground surface outside the 
shoulder.  
 
3.8.1 State-of-the Practice 
 
Delineators/pylons are primarily used at reversible plazas to separate vehicles traveling in 
opposite directions, to separate higher speed dedicated lanes from the lower speed cash 
lanes and along the plaza approach and departure zones to assist merging and diverging 
traffic as it approaches and departs the plaza, respectively.    Delineators/pylons have also 
been used within the shoulder at the tolling point of express lanes and ETC dedicated lanes 
to prevent vehicles from eluding capture by the violation enforcement system cameras. 
 
3.8.2 Survey Results 
 
No survey questions regarding delineation were offered. 
 
3.8.3 Expert Panel Workshop Recommendations 
 
The panel recommended the use of delineators/pylons only for non-stop toll lanes.   
 
3.8.4 Recommended Guidelines 
Significant shortcomings with delineators/pylons are a relatively high maintenance cost and 
potential damage and loss of function from snow removal operations. Pop-up delineators/
pylons require more extensive maintenance service to ensure the delineator’s retraction and 
release mechanism is fully operational at all times. Delineators/pylons do not provide the 
physical separation needed to prevent an errant vehicle from crossing into an adjacent lane. 
The advantage of delineators/pylons is the low cost to remove and replace these devices to 
accommodate reconfiguration of the plaza. Also, for drivers that lose control of their vehi-
cles but avoid colliding with another vehicle or a rigid structure, can avoid injury and incur-
ring significant property damage by striking delineators/pylons before regaining control.  
Design considerations for these devices are presented in section 4.5.

Title Plaza Delineation 
Text Flexible delineators/pylons for lane separation should not be installed  
within a conventional plaza unless a quantitative and qualitative benefit-
cost analysis supports the use of these devices. 
Commentary High maintenance cost and a lack of true physical separation are expected 
to eventually lead to more durable and reliable alternatives for separating 
vehicles.   For reversible lanes, the expected high maintenance costs of 
pop-up delineators/pylons may be less than the equipment, labor and 
materials costs and the possible delay cost imposed when relocating the 
barrier that are associated with moveable barrier, the primary physical 
separation alternative.

3.9 FLASHING BEACONS/WARNING LIGHTS 
 
A flashing beacon is a highway traffic signal with one or more signal sections that operates 
in a flashing mode.  It is used for warning applications at toll collection facilities, generally 
for providing a supplemental warning emphasis.   
 
 
3.9.1 State-of-the-Practice 
 
Flashing or warning beacons are positioned by some agencies next to lane-use signals, 
centered over the toll collection lanes.  Other overhead applications include at the left and 
right sides of the overhead lane signs mounted on the toll plaza canopies.  Besides 
overhead locations, beacons are sometimes installed on crash blocks or ramparts on the toll 
island to draw attention to the location of the toll island as users approach the plaza, 
particularly under adverse weather and poor lighting conditions.   
 
The survey of toll agencies found that use of flashing beacons for ETC dedicated lanes is 
common, although the most common use is mounting flashing beacons on toll island 
concrete, at a height of 1.6 to 4 feet.  The beacons are normally flashing, though some use 
steady burns.  The beacons are either 8 or 12 inches in diameter and yellow or amber in 
color. 
 
The MUTCD 2003 provides guidelines for general design and operations of flashing 
beacons.  The standard design should follow the provisions for traffic control signal 
features, with a flashing rate between 50 and 60 times per minute.

Flashing Beacon Design Issues and Guideline Development 
 
Some of the significant issues to consider in using flashing beacons/warning lights are 
the following: 
 
· Avoiding confusion by approaching users with the installation of a flashing beacon 
next to a lane-use signal centered over a toll lane;  
· Selecting a location to mount a flashing beacon on both sides of the canopy lane 
status sign that results in maximum effectiveness in distinguishing a dedicated ETC 
lane both at a distance and within the queue zone of the conventional plaza; 
· Selecting a location to install a flashing beacon on either an impact attenuator backup 
blocks or toll island crash block/rampart that will be most effective in avoiding 
single vehicle collisions with the toll island protection materials; 
· The flashing beacon design and installation should be in full compliance with the 
MUTCD. 
 
Flashing Beacon Guidelines 
 
Guideline Flashing Beacons/Warning Lights Design Guideline 1  
Title Supplement to Lane-use Signals 
Text Flashing beacons should not be installed together with lane-use signals, 
as it provides contradictory information to drivers. 
Commentary Use with lane-use signals presents contradiction to MUTCD. 
Guideline Flashing Beacons/Warning Lights Design Guideline 2 
Title Supplemental to Canopy Signs 
Text Flashing beacons may be used as warning devices with canopy lane 
status signs for ETC dedicated lanes only, with the intended purpose of 
indicating the location of the dedicated ETC lane (s) when approaching 
the conventional plaza lanes. 
Commentary Installation of the flashing beacon at the bottom of the lane status sign 
has been shown to be effective in highlighting the location of the ETC 
dedicated lanes when maneuvering within the queue zone to find the 
toll lane with the shortest vehicle queue.

Commentary Use should be limited as much as possible to minimize distractions to 
drivers.  Only the yellow color application should be considered.  An 
automatic dimming device may be used to reduce the brilliance during 
night operation.  The flashing beacons mounted on the island should 
be at an appropriate height above the ground for viewing.

CHAPTER 4 
 
GEOMETRIC AND SAFETY DESIGN 
 
 
The design of a toll plaza is primarily performed based on quantifiable factors: travel 
demand, traffic mix, type of toll system (i.e.. barrier or closed ticket), methods of toll 
collection that account for plaza configurations suited for initial and future toll rates (e.g., 
high rates preclude automatic (ACM) lanes), existing water, power and communication 
infrastructure, right-of-way availability at proposed plaza location, potential sources of 
radio frequency (RF) interference, and roadway, bridge or tunnel mainline approach and 
departure geometrics. Additionally, some important toll plaza planning issues include: 
initial and ultimate right-of-way needs, environmental mitigation issues including wetlands, 
historic preservation, air, noise and light pollution, arrangements for on-site violation 
enforcement patrols, staffing needs, provisions for staff safety, cash handling security 
options, budget, and accessibility (i.e., Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) provisions).   
These factors are unique and vary considerably across all toll plazas.  Some of these factors 
are identified in Chapter 2. 
 
While the primary objective of this report is to addresses traffic control strategies and 
applications, it is recognized that roadway geometrics and safety design of toll plazas play a 
complementary role in the implementation of these strategies.  As the MUTCD is the 
national standard for traffic control devices and measures, the AASHTO A Policy on 
Geometric Design of Highways and Streets, 5th edition, 2004 (i.e., Green Book) provides relevant 
standards for all NHS highways on geometrics and safety design and is used extensively for 
reference purposes in this section.  Many toll agencies refer to either their own 
independently published manuals or the respective state DOT’s roadway and bridge design 
manual for guidance.   
 
Recognizing that many factors greatly influence the toll plaza design, the following sections 
address specific design issues, identifying the state-of-the-practice and offering 
recommended guidelines wherever appropriate.    
 
  4.1 APPROACH ZONES  
 The approach zone of a conventional plaza design is the area in advance of the toll plaza.  
 It includes a transition area where the pavement widens at a specified taper rate from either 
 the mainline roadway section to the width of the conventional plaza toll lanes, plus a queue 
 zone with no taper prior to the front edge of the toll islands (see Figure 3 in the Glossary).  
 If the toll plaza has express lanes, the approach transition zone extends from the start of 
 the gore area where the conventional plaza lanes diverge from the express lanes.

Approach queue zones from the project survey results range from 100 feet to over 1300 
feet, with an average of 528.7 feet.  Lengths may be attributed to an inadequate number of 
toll plaza lanes or the longer lengths could include the transition areas.  Taper rates on toll 
roads were found to range from approximately 4 to 40, with an average of 9.  On toll 
bridges, this range was from 2 to 17, with an average of 5.  As expected, tapers for bridges 
and tunnels tend to be shorter, presumably the result of a shorter overall approach zone.

  Conventional Plaza Approach Taper Rates              
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
T h e 
MUTCD 2003 and AASHTO “Green Book” provide diverging taper rates for lane 
additions and drops.  However, neither of these sources provides taper rates specifically for 
the approach zones of conventional plazas.  The AASHTO “Green Book’s” policy of 
interdependence of taper rates and speed should be considered in the design to assure a 
safe transition. 
4.1.2 Recommended Guidelines  
 Approach Zone Design Issues 
 
 Some significant issues to consider in designing approach zones include the following: 
· available right-of-way or space,  
· greater ETC penetration and future addition of express lanes or conversion to open 
road tolling,  
· proximity to upstream interchange on-ramps, 
· express lane alignment and separation from conventional plaza lanes,  
· profile grade and cross slopes for low maintenance drainage, 
· pavement materials to minimize frequency of rehabilitation and reconstruction, 
· queue zone pavement materials providing best foundation support for impact 
attenuators, 
· number of roadway (e.g., mainline, ramp) lanes feeding the toll plaza, 
· number of conventional plaza toll lanes, both current and future, including ETC 
dedicated and cash lanes,  
· queue zone requirements based on an analysis of throughput capacity of proposed 
configuration during peak periods, 
· provisions for oversized trucks to turn around or perform another safe maneuver to 
exit a plaza area, particularly before entering or crossing a bridge or tunnel, 
respectively, unless provided in the departure zone.

Approach Zone Guideline Development 
 
The design development work performed in 1999 by McDonald1 and in 2001 by 
McDonald and Stammer2 should be used as the basis for the layout of approach zones.  
For agencies with existing  design standards, the stated reference should function as a 
supplement.  
 
The number of toll lanes needed to accommodate the forecasted design year traffic 
volumes can be determined manually by the use of queue theory models and calculations or 
through the use of plaza simulation techniques.  Some examples of simulation packages are  
the following: 
 
TOLLSIM, is a simulation model developed by Wilbur Smith Associates to analyze the toll 
operation at the approach to the toll plaza.  It requires traffic data and lane type 
configuration, ramp approaches and the storage length of each lane.  The model produces 
simulation analysis results in graphic and number format, listing a number of measures of 
effectiveness such as delay per lane, delay overall, and queue length.  No analysis of traffic 
operation downstream from the toll plaza can be performed. 
 
VISSIM, is a general simulation model that can be tailored for toll plaza performance 
analysis.  It requires the same input data listed above under TOLLSIM.  In addition, 
calibration is required to match existing toll operations in the field.  The advantage of 
VISSIM is that the user can analyze the highway leading to the plaza, downstream from the 
plaza and at the plaza.  The interactions between these locations are seamless in this model. 
 
CORSIM, is also a simulation model commonly used for highway corridors.  It can be used 
in conjunction with TOLLSIM to analyze the traffic operations on the ramps and local 
roadway system downstream from the toll plaza.  Although it can theoretically simulate 
operations at a toll plaza, this is not a straightforward modeling effort, requiring resolution 
of some inherent complications.

Title Transition Zone Tapers 
Text Transition zone tapers approaching the conventional plaza should use 
the minimum taper rates presented in the McDonald 1999 and 
McDonald and Stammer 2001 reports.  The diverge tapers from the 
latter publication for speeds of  40 mph or less is specified as 
L=WS/105 and for speeds 45 mph or more and L=3/8 WS for 
speeds 45 mph or more, where L= minimum length (ft.), S= posted 
approach speed in mph, and W= offset distance in feet.  Use of a 
smaller taper for wide plazas and a minimum taper of 10:1 for speeds 
less than 30 mph was recommended.    
Commentary Reference the ITE Freeway and Interchange Geometric Design 
Handbook – Chapter 13 for further design information on taper rates. 
Guideline Approach Zones Design Guideline 1 
Title Queue Zone Lengths 
Text The length of queuing zone should be based on estimated or actual 
peak hour queue lengths, determined by an analysis, plus an added 
safety factor, with a minimum of 200 feet.  Design year traffic 
volumes should be used. 
Commentary For plaza reconstruction and expansion, design should make use of a 
simulation model to calibrate existing plaza operations and to estimate 
plaza queuing and toll lane usage, or use professionally acceptable 
manual calculation methods (note: vehicle mix, daily/weekend/
holiday profiles, and unusual demand generators).  The analysis must 
account for increased usage of express lanes and ETC dedicated lanes 
which is expected to reduce conventional plaza queuing in the future.

Title Proximity to On-ramp 
Text If the distance to safely change lanes to access the express lanes after 
entering the mainline from an upstream interchange on-ramp is not 
sufficient, this movement should be physically prevented through the 
use of barrier or delineator/pylons separated auxiliary lane extensions. 
Commentary Existence of an ETC dedicated lane or provisions to add one within 
the conventional plaza should minimize any inconvenience to the 
ETC customer.

4.2  DEPARTURE ZONES  
The departure zone of a conventional plaza is the area encountered by a driver upon 
exiting a toll lane.  It includes the recovery zone, which is a non-tapered extension of the 
toll lanes downstream of the toll islands used for driver re-orientation and acceleration, 
followed by a departure transition area downstream of the recovery zone where the 
pavement narrows at a specified taper rate from the conventional plaza width to the total 
width of the mainline or ramp  (see the Glossary).  This can be more complicated with 
separate express toll lanes and often results in either no taper or a minimal taper on the side 
adjacent to the express lane and requires the transition pavement width to merge with the 
express lanes (typically on the mainline alignment) consistent with interchange design 
standards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
4.2.1 State-of-the-Practice 
 
Departure recovery zones from the project survey results range from 100 feet to over 1300 
feet, with an average of 500.7 feet.  Although it is uncertain whether the longer lengths 
include the transition areas, this is likely the case.  As shown in Table 4.2, departure zone 
taper rates on toll roads were found to range from approximately 3 to 40, with an average 
of 9.  For toll bridges, this range was from 4 to 11, with an average of 6.  As expected, 
tapers for bridges and tunnels tend to be shorter, presumably the result of a shorter overall 
departure zone. 
 
Table 4.2  
Conventional Plaza Departure Taper Rates 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The MUTCD 2003 and AASHTO “Green Book” provide taper rates for lane additions 
and drops.  However, neither of these sources provides taper rates specifically for 
departure zones of conventional plazas.  The AASHTO “Green Book” policy of 
interdependence of taper rates and speed should be considered in the design to assure a 
safe transition.

Departure Zone Guideline Development 
 
The design development work performed in 1999 by McDonald and in 2001 by McDonald 
and Stammer should be used as the basis for the layout of departure zones.  For agencies 
with existing design standards, the stated reference should function as a supplement.

Guideline Departure Zones Design Guideline 1  
Title Recovery Zone Lengths 
Text The departure recovery zone should be equal to at least 200 feet and 
preferably 300 feet, a length expected to allow sufficient driver re-
orientation, acceleration, and initial merge distance after exiting the 
plaza.  
Commentary For tunnel and bridge toll plazas, a longer recovery zone may be 
warranted for oversized vehicles to safely maneuver out of the plaza 
area if sensors and physical constraints are not available or deployed to 
detect an oversized vehicle prior to entering a toll lane, thereby 
precluding any maneuver to exit the plaza on or before the plaza 
approach.

minimum taper of 10:1 for speeds less than 30 mph was recommended.  
Commentary Reference the ITE Freeway and Interchange Geometric Design

Guideline Departure Zones Design Guideline 3  
Title Proximity to Off-ramp 
Text If the distance to safely change lanes to reach the exit lane of a nearby 
downstream interchange from an express lane is not sufficient, this 
movement should be physically prevented by a downstream extension 
of the raised median or barrier separating express lanes and merging 
conventional plaza lanes.  
Commentary New construction should avoid potential information overload related 
to informing ETC users to exit the facility through the conventional 
plaza lanes in lieu of the express lanes by locating the plaza a sufficient 
distance from entry and exit ramps. For existing facilities, advance 
signing should be used to direct traffic that will be exiting at an 
interchange ramp just downstream of the plaza to use the conventional 
toll plaza lanes in lieu of the express lanes.  Existence of an ETC 
dedicated lane or provisions to add one within the conventional plaza 
should minimize any inconvenience to ETC customers. The number of 
ETC dedicated lanes required should  be calculated by estimating the 
percentage of ETC users exiting at a nearby downstream interchange 
ramp after traveling through a conventional plaza and or the percentage 
of ETC users entering the conventional plaza from a nearby upstream 
interchange on ramp. These percentages are then converted to volumes 
of dedicated lane ETC traffic and combined with an estimated residual 
of ETC traffic that elects to use the dedicated lane in lieu of the express 
lanes or all ETC mainline traffic if there are no express lanes.

Title Express Lane Departure 
Text The departure recovery and transition zones should be fully completed 
prior to the merge with continuing express lanes. (i.e. merged lanes 
should equal the number of lanes on the typical roadway section 
downstream of the plaza area), subject to provisions for merging with 
any express lanes. 
Commentary An auxiliary lane may be used to temporarily increase the number of 
lanes merging with the continuing roadway lanes after exiting the 
conventional plaza.  
Guideline Departure Zones Design Guideline 5  
Title Recovery Zone Dedicated Lane Design 
Text Placement of physical separation devices for dedicated lane traffic 
should be extended beyond the toll islands until traffic in the adjacent 
lanes that had stopped to pay the toll has accelerated to 50% of the 
operating speed.  As a minimum, solid white striping should continue 
until the accelerating traffic has reached a point of approximately two-
thirds (66%) of the operating speed based on the average acceleration 
rate of a mid-size vehicle. 
Commentary Although specific locations are provided, the intent is to minimize the 
potential hazards of differential speeds when exiting a toll plaza.

4.3  EXPRESS LANES   
 
There are many real and potential safety concerns at toll plazas, with particular regard to 
multiple payment methods that include ETC technology. Inclusion of this technology at 
toll plazas introduces another payment option for users that may add to their confusion on 
lane choice.  ETC technology eliminates the need for drivers to stop for toll payment.  As 
such, it creates speed differentials in the overall flow of traffic.  In an effort to minimize 
conflicts and adverse conditions associated with these speed differentials, the higher speed 
ETC lanes are physically separated from the conventional plaza lanes where cash payment 
requires the vehicle to stop.  
 
The ETC dedicated lane within a conventional plaza is only equipped to collect tolls 
electronically, thereby limiting use of the lane to vehicles having a valid transponder.  
Dedicated lanes usually do not require the driver to stop their vehicle, however, due to 
physical constraints, collection staff safety, and speed differential concerns, the allowable 
travel speed is usually much less than the posted speed limit on the approach to the toll 
plaza. Express lanes ideally are effectively equivalent in design to the approach and 
departure roadway sections.  Typically the number of express lanes are less than the 
approach roadway lanes.  Barrier are installed to prevent access to the express lanes from 
the conventional plaza. Express lanes are capable of supporting a much higher throughput 
of traffic and result in the least amount of delay relative to all plaza lane types. Because a 
single express lane prevents a user from passing a slower moving vehicle and requires wide 
shoulders to assure continued vehicle passage if lane blockage occurs, two express lanes are 
often considered a practical minimum.  
 
To minimize conflicts, locating express lanes to the far left of a directional toll plaza is 
generally recommended, since faster drivers typically stay to the left and the approach 
roadway alignment is easier to maintain through the express lanes. To separate high speed, 
non-stop vehicles from the conventional plaza that supports both lower speed ETC 
dedicated lanes and cash lanes, a barrier, or raised median providing an adequate clear zone, 
or a combination of both is normally used commensurate with the speed of the approach 
roadway.  This configuration also discourages drivers from making lane changes close to 
the toll plaza.   
 
4.3.1 State-of-the-Practice 
 
The tables below present the project survey results related to express lanes configuration, 
and the type of barriers used on either side of these lanes.  Note that almost all agencies 
have express lanes that are a continuation of the mainline or ramp roadway, rather than 
tapering to one side or the other. One variation to this configuration is the tapering of the 
express lanes to their ultimate location within the median, the location where all future 
widening is planned to occur that will ultimately align the future “inside” mainline lanes 
with the initially constructed express lanes.  This approach avoids the need for future 
expansion to the outside and the attendant changes to interchange ramp connections. 
Based on the survey results provided below, most agencies use concrete barriers on each 
side of the express lanes.

4.3.2 Survey Results 
 
 
 
Placing higher speed lanes on the left, consistent with highway travel is most common.  
However, some agencies have constructed their express ETC lanes on the right side of the 
plaza to accommodate reversible lanes or to provide staff access to and egress from a 
median facility (i.e. administration building and parking lot).  There are added challenges 
with this approach, including requiring higher speed traffic to veer to the right, followed by 
a merge with slower conventional plaza traffic.

Express ETC Lane Design Issues and Guideline Development 
 
Some of the significant issues to consider in establishing express lanes include the 
following: 
 
· potential solution for alleviating speed differentials in the conventional plaza 
that includes ETC dedicated lanes and cash lanes, 
· location of the express lanes under both the initial and ultimate builds,  
· minimizing abrupt lane changes at the tolling point and license plate image 
capture zone, 
· safe and operationally efficient divergence of traffic into the express lanes and 
conventional plaza lane when approaching a plaza, 
· safe and operationally efficient merge of express lanes and conventional plaza 
traffic downstream of the toll plaza, 
· provisions for maintaining existing reversible lane operations in the 
conventional plaza after verifying the need to continue the operation of these 
lanes, 
· maintaining the existing location of the administration building and parking 
within the roadway median, 
· weave length from upstream on-ramp gore to express lane - conventional 
plaza approach gore, 
· weave length from express lane - conventional plaza departure gore to 
downstream off-ramp gore,  
· allocation of available right-of-way to the express lanes, conventional plaza 
lanes, administration building(s) and any plaza bypass lanes.

Express Lane Design Guidelines 
 
Guideline Express Lane Design Guideline 1  
Title Lane Placement 
Text To avoid or minimize potential conflicts, express lanes should be 
located to the far left of the plaza. 
Commentary This is consistent with general highway travel, therefore, meets the 
expectations of the drivers.  This effectively prohibits any reversible 
lane operation.  Facilities where staff must access tollbooths or toll 
equipment from a facility located in the median, a tunnel or overhead 
walkway is needed to accommodate express lanes located to the far left.  
See Chapter 2 for more information on toll plaza configuration. 
Guideline Express Lane Design Guideline 2  
Title Express Lane Design 
Text Design of express lanes should preferably be a continuation of the 
normal mainline lanes with similar features (i.e. design speed, lane 
widths, and shoulder widths).  The split between the express lanes and 
the conventional plaza lanes should occur prior to approach transition 
zone for the adjacent conventional plaza, and the merge downstream of 
the toll plaza should occur after the departure transition zone. (see 
Figure-3 and subsections 4.1 and 4.2) 
Commentary A barrier wall, guardrail, delineators/pylons and/or other types of 
physical separation should be considered between the express lanes and 
the conventional toll plaza lanes when highway standard clear zone 
separation is available to prevent confused and deviant drivers from 
trying to access the conventional plaza.  
Guideline Express Lane Design Guideline 3  
Title Diverging and Merging Express Lane and Conventional Plaza Lane 
Traffic  
Text Design of the conventional plaza approach and departure zones from 
and to the roadway mainline should comply with pertinent elements of 
interchange design, whereby the express lanes “should function” the 
same as the mainline through lanes.  
Commentary The design must account for the available right-of-way and the ultimate 
number of express and conventional plaza lanes, shoulder widths, and 
median.  The ultimate express lane width should be equal to the 
ultimate mainline cross section.

4.4 LANE AND SHOULDER WIDTHS 
 
Historically, the width of conventional plaza toll lanes, particularly automatic lanes, tend to 
be narrower than the adopted width for freeway lanes.  This is done to encourage the 
driver to slow their vehicle through the toll plaza lanes, thereby minimizing the potential 
for vehicle and equipment damage and to more quickly maneuver the vehicle into position 
to complete a transaction.  However, express lanes must be designed for travel at higher 
speeds.  Furthermore, shoulders for express lanes need to be designed similar to a freeway 
typical section, for safety and refuge purposes, as well as to minimize capacity loss due to 
lane blockage. 
4.4.1 State-of-the-Practice 
 
Tables below present the project survey findings for lane widths of different modes of toll 
collection for toll roads and toll bridges (i.e., manual, automatic coin machine/automatic

Lane and Shoulder Width Design Issues and Guideline Development 
 
The AASHTO “Green Book” does not specifically mention anything related to toll lane 
widths.  Consequently, the AASHTO recommended 12 foot width should be adopted for 
express lanes. As described above, conventional plaza lanes have historically been less than 
12 feet, although this is not necessarily applicable to newer conventional plaza designs.  
Twelve (12) foot wide toll lanes can comfortably accommodate larger vehicles and elderly 
drivers than in narrower lanes where they may come in contact with toll island equipment.  
Oversized loads (up to 14 feet wide) need to be accommodated in at least one lane, subject 
to state/local permit requirements.   Oversized vehicles are usually handled in the far right 
lane where a shoulder can be used to provide additional lane width. 
 
An ITE report recommends that manual, ACM/ATM, and dedicated ETC lanes have the 
following minimum widths: 
Some of the significant issues to consider in establishing lane and shoulder widths include 
the following: 
· speed reduction through the toll plaza, 
· potential for damage to vehicles and toll equipment installed near the edge of the toll 
island as the result of contact between these mobile and stationary items, respectively, 
· provisions for handling large trucks and over-sized vehicles, 
· provisions for passage of maintenance vehicles, 
· refuge for disabled vehicles in express lanes, 
· refuge for law enforcement vehicles for on-site violation enforcement details and 
homeland security functions, 
· provisions for emergency vehicle access to express lanes during peak-hour periods, 
· in cases with insufficient median width only, possible tapered reduction to the inside 
express lane shoulder width to accommodate gantry supports, 
· capacity loss due to partial or full lane blockage, 
· available right of way and overall plaza width. 
 
 
Lanes with less than 10% trucks 10 feet minimum 
Lanes with 10-30% trucks 11 feet minimum 
Lanes with over 30% trucks 12 feet minimum

Commentary Some shoulder restriction may be needed to the inside shoulder to 
accommodate a bridge or gantry structure foundation used to support 
overhead toll and violation enforcement equipment when the median 
width is insufficient. This isolated shoulder restriction should be 
tapered and the shoulder width reduction should be limited in length to 
minimize the impact on an emergency vehicle using the shoulder to 
bypass congested traffic conditions subject to the shoulder width being 
sufficient for vehicle travel.

4.5 TOLL ISLAND 
 
The toll island provides physical lane separation and protects the tollbooth, agency staff, 
and toll collection equipment within the conventional plaza. It provides a foundation for 
the canopy and tollbooth, conceals conduits and wireways, and forms a part of an access 
way to either a tunnel or overhead walkway.  In addition, the toll island  provides the 
foundation for equipment used in lanes operating in manual and automatic collection 
modes.  This equipment includes an automatic coin machine, an automatic ticket issuing 
machine, traffic control equipment including the island traffic signal, and automatic 
barrier gate, and display equipment such as a patron toll display and any speed display 
sign. Crash protection on the island approach end of a manual lane is provided to protect 
the attendant, tollbooth and equipment, along with anyone using the integral stairs from 
either an overhead walkway or tunnel. The crash protection generally includes the 
following items, listed from the furthest to the closest to the tollbooth: crash cushion/
impact attenuator, rampart, and crash block(s).  Impact attenuators are not intended to 
reduce the number of accidents, but rather the severity of an accident.  The rampart and 
crash block(s) are intended to protect the attendant, tollbooth and toll collection 
equipment. 
 
4.5.1 State-of-the-Practice 
 
The vast majority of tollbooths and toll collection equipment are installed on toll islands 
constructed of concrete that rises above the toll lane pavement surface. The higher 
surface provides the following: a solid foundation for a tollbooth, canopy, and traffic 
control and toll related equipment, a platform for an attendant to service trucks, 
aesthetics enhancement of the plaza by concealing conduit runs, and a means of diverting 
drainage away from a tollbooth and any openings to the tunnel below the booth.  
Agencies and departments use ramparts and/or crash blocks, either separately cast or 
monolithic with the toll island concrete, to protect the tollbooth, attendant and toll 
related equipment.  Some agencies have combined planters with crash blocks to make the 
plaza more aesthetically appealing. Observation of the conventional toll plaza of many 
agencies and departments indicates impact attenuators are installed in front of the toll 
island to provide additional protection for the tollbooth and toll attendant.  
 
If an automatic barrier gate, which blocks traffic from exiting the lane until the toll due is 
paid, is not deployed, agencies were found to provide protection for attendants, 
supervisors and maintenance staff crossing toll islands and lanes by using chains, ropes, 
gates or some other type of moveable barrier installed on the toll island and preventing 
walking into a toll lane with non-stop traffic. A majority of the agencies surveyed use a 
crash cushion/attenuator in front of toll islands.  Additionally, pavement markings are 
used immediately in front of the crash cushions/attenuator to provide advance warning 
to drivers and to guide them into making a lane selection prior to reaching the crash 
cushion/attenuator.

However, the AASHTO Roadside Design Guide 2002 presents information on various types 
of crash cushions/impact attenuators.  It also provides information regarding grades and 
curbs near crash cushions.   
 
Some agencies and departments were found to use some form of safety related signing or 
pavement crosswalk markings across the lane between islands for warning drivers of 
agency staff who may stray into the lane.  These can be pavement markings and/or 
simple standard stop signs, “modified or enhanced” non-standard stop signs, or some 
type of crossing warning sign.

 4.5.3 Recommended Guidelines  
 
Island Design Issues and Guideline Development 
 
Some of the significant issues to consider when designing a toll island and 
recommendations for resolving these issues include the following: 
 
· The island design needs to be capable of supporting a tollbooth, a canopy whose load 
is transferred to the island through columns and toll collection equipment; conceal 
unsightly conduit runs; and provide protection for a stairwell to either an access tunnel 
or overhead walkway.  Cast-in-place reinforced concrete provides a durable foundation 
that can be formed to achieve various shapes and contours around openings and 
conduits can easily be embedded to route wires and cable to the tollbooth and island 
equipment.  
  
· The island design must provide a means of securely anchoring the tollbooth and 
provide a positive means of clearance from the edge of travel way.  A concrete 
blockout allows the bottom edge of the tollbooth to be anchored below the surface of 
the island. This prevents the displacement of the booth into a lane if the anchor bolts 
are sheared as the result of a vehicle collision.  A minimum one foot ledge from the 
tollbooth wall to the outside edge of island is recommended to protect the tollbooth 
from damage by passing vehicles.  
   
· When agency staff and visitors must cross multiple lanes to get to their desired island 
location, provisions for an island refuge prior to a crossing lanes should be provided. It 
is recommended the tollbooth be installed in juxtaposition to canopy supports and toll 
equipment so that there is an access-way in a straight alignment across all islands in a 
particular direction of travel. If the access way is installed behind the tollbooth, line of 
sight to approaching vehicles should not be obscured by the booth when standing near 
the edge of the island.   
  
· Agency staff and visitors may inadvertently walk into a dedicated or cash lane when 
crossing lanes coincident with a vehicle passing through the lane. Alternative solutions 
range from a warning sign to installing a pedestrian gate or other moveable barrier that 
blocks access across the lane without taking some positive action. If staff is required to 
cross a lane that provides ETC, crossing the lane should be blocked by a rope, chain, 
gate or other moveable item. An exception is when the lane has an automatic gate that 
is not held in an open position during peak periods.  For crossing a cash lane without 
ETC capability, a conspicuously located warning sign is recommended to achieve a 
minimum level of pedestrian safety when crossing toll lanes. 
 
· Although an impact attenuator is expected to absorb a significant portion of an errant 
vehicle’s momentum, the island design must incorporate feature(s) to prevent all 
vehicles from a head -on collision with the tollbooth.  The commonly used solution 
consisting of ramparts and crash blocks that satisfies the following criteria is 
recommended:  
 
 
 126

N
D
 
o capable of sustaining vehicular impacts, 
o does not block the vision of the attendant, 
o consistent with any plaza architectural theme, 
o does not launch a vehicle when impacted, 
o designed to be monolithic with or securely anchored to the island to 
prevent any displacement as a result of a vehicle collision, and 
o requires minimal maintenance. 
 
· The island design must provide appropriate clearances and accommodate the strategic 
placement of toll collection and traffic control equipment and devices, displays, and 
signs to meet functional requirements while avoiding the appearance of clutter and 
information overload.  The  dimensions of the island should be established based on 
the planned or existing tollbooth exterior dimensions, provisions for a stairwell for 
tunnel or overhead walkway access and the recommended locations of the items listed. 
The island width should be a minimum of six (6) feet, based on a maximum tollbooth 
width of four (4) feet. All plaza islands should be of the same length in a particular 
direction of travel even though automatic lanes usually require a smaller island than 
manual or attended lanes. From a safety perspective, the toll island should be a 
minimum height of six (6) inches, which is equivalent to municipal and state standards 
for arterial roadway curbs.  However, added protection is warranted for the safety of 
the collector and protection of the agency’s investment in equipment and the tollbooth 
installed on the toll island. This is particularly relevant with the addition of ETC 
capability that commonly results in higher speeds through the lane. The AASHTO 
“Green Book” defines a barrier curb as eight (8) inches. A height exceeding this 
exacerbates the difficulty of servicing low profile sports vehicles. For new facilities, the 
recommended height is eight (8) inches, assuming the elevation of the tollbooth floor 
is approximately equal to the surface of the island downstream of the booth.   
 
· The location of the island needs to be clear to all approaching traffic under all lighting 
and weather conditions.  To assure visibility of the toll island the design should 
incorporate a beacon/fog light mounted to the mass concrete protection on the 
approach end of the island and installed at a height that is visible to all approaching 
traffic. The visibility of any impact attenuator should be enhanced using reflectors and 
reflective tape.

Toll Island Guidelines 
 
 
Guideline Toll Island Guideline 1 
Title Island Width 
Text The island width should be a minimum of six (6) feet, subject to 
providing at least a minimum of one (1) foot of clearance on each 
side of the tollbooth or combined booth and ACM/ATIM 
equipment.  For standalone ACM/ATIM equipment lanes, the width 
should be based on safe clearance for servicing (e.g., changing coin 
vaults, stacking tickets, maintenance servicing) the equipment, subject 
to the recommended minimum.  
Commentary Design must consider an acceptable clearance offsets for ACM/
ATIM equipment from the curb face for customer convenience 
during transactions.  
Guideline Toll Island Guideline 2 
Title Toll Island Length 
Text The length of a toll island can vary based on the following: design of 
island access facilities (e.g., stairwell, stairway), space requirements for 
toll collection and traffic control equipment, and provisions for toll-
booth and equipment protection.  Toll island length in a conventional 
plaza should be uniform even though the island supporting manual 
collection tends to be the longest and ETC dedicated lanes tend to be 
the shortest. Specifically, the length of a manual island depends on the 
design of the tollbooth; design of any stairway for an overhead walk-
way or stairwell for an access tunnel; provisions for violation enforce-
ment and traffic control equipment; tollbooth protection; design of 
canopy supports; provisions for staff access across the islands; and 
aesthetic considerations. 
Commentary A possible exception to the manual lane being the control island 
length is when ACM/ATIM equipped lanes (i.e., automatic lanes) per-
mit truck use and thereby deploy a pre-classification subsystem that 
requires a minimum 5-axle truck length in advance of the ACM/
ATIM equipment so the correct toll or class can be displayed or 
printed to the ticket, respectively.

Guideline Toll Island Guideline 3 
Title Rampart and Crash Blocks 
Text Tollbooth protection provided by ramparts and crash blocks should 
be designed to withstand anticipated loads of design vehicles. The 
rampart should be designed to redirect errant vehicles and not launch 
the vehicle.  Crash blocks are constructed of reinforced concrete and 
can incorporate aesthetic features such as planters.  
Commentary Double crash blocks should be considered if large vehicles are 
permitted.  Longer blocks may be considered in lieu of a rampart.  
Design should be performed by an experienced structural engineer.  
If planters are used, any planted vegetation should not block the 
collector’s vision of approaching vehicles and a filtered drainage 
outlet is required.  
Guideline Toll Island Guideline 4 
Title Staff Access 
Text Grade separated access to toll islands should be considered so no more 
than a single lane must be crossed to gain access to the intended island.  
Design should include a means to block access into the adjacent lane by 
installing a pedestrian gate, moveable barrier, or a chain or rope strung 
between two posts at the edges of the toll island to warn and protect 
staff crossing lanes.  
Commentary Two alternatives for grade-separated crossing access are an access tun-
nel immediately below the tollbooth and an overhead walkway. In addi-
tion to stairway access to these facilities, for new construction ADA 
regulations may require the inclusion of elevator access subject to offi-
cial job descriptions and minimum requirements to perform the work If 
using a pedestrian gate or moveable barrier, it should not extend into 
the adjacent toll lane when “open”.

4.6 CROSS SLOPES 
 
The cross slope is the percent of elevation change along the cross section of highway 
pavement.  Cross slopes are necessary to provide adequate drainage in the vicinity of toll 
plazas. However, excessive rollover must be avoided.  Rollover is the change in slope 
between two adjacent road pavements.  This could occur between two adjacent travel lanes, 
or the travelway and shoulder. 
 
4.6.1 State-of-the-Practice     
The project survey results of cross slopes for express lanes had a range of 1.5%-3.0%, with 
2% the most common. 
 
Adequate cross slopes need to be constructed to facilitate proper pavement drainage. 
Providing adequate drainage is critical in the vicinity of the toll plaza, particularly during 
periods of low temperatures that promote the formation of ice.  Express lanes should 
adhere to the guidelines used for the mainline highway segment. 
 
The AASHTO Roadside Design Guide 2002 states that grades (profile or cross slopes) should 
be avoided near crash cushions, as these grades can adversely affect the errant vehicle 
impact angle and possibly the collapse mechanism of the impact attenuator under load. 
Mainline plazas constructed on roadway curve sections present special challenges in 
meeting this criteria because of provisions for superelevation.  
 
4.6.2 Recommended Guidelines  
 
Cross Slope Design Issues and Guideline Development 
 
Some of the significant issues to consider when designing a toll island and 
recommendations for resolving these issues include the following: 
 
· slopes that promote storm water runoff from roadway and canopy, 
· location of inlets, grates, catch basins and other drainage facilities to handle 
runoff, 
· consideration of superelevation for conventional plazas constructed on 
roadway curves, 
· use of cross slopes and profile grades in lieu of inlets within the toll lanes to 
prevent ponding and assure heavy drainage flows have no affect on safety and 
throughput, particularly as a result of a clogged drain, 
· use of minimal cross slope in lanes where treadles are installed to avoid any 
degradation in performance, 
· rollover of adjacent lanes with differing cross slopes.

Guideline Cross Slope Design Guideline 1 
Title Cross Slope Ranges 
Text Design of cross slopes should follow the methods and guidelines 
provided by the AASHTO “Green Book” and or the respective state 
DOT design manuals.  Drainage design needs to address runoff from 
the canopy. Cross slopes will typically range from 1%-2% on tangent 
roadway sections and higher on curves.  
Commentary The drainage design must combine cross slopes with longitudinal grade 
to avoid any water ponding within the toll plaza.  Canopy runoff should 
be directly piped into the drainage system.  
Guideline Cross Slope Design Guideline 2 
Title Rollover Ranges 
Text Design of rollover of adjacent lanes should follow the methods and 
guidelines provided by the AASHTO “Green Book” and or the

4.7 VERTICAL PROFILE GRADES 
The vertical profile grade is the percent of elevation change along the centerline of the roadway. 
Vertical grades are necessary to assure drainage of storm water within the plaza to inlets and or 
outfall locations. Profile grades affectively reduce construction costs by more closely following 
the natural grade within the established right of way, balancing the quantity of excavation and 
embankment material and reducing the foundation and earthwork cost of bridges.  
4.7.1 State-of-the-Practice 
 
The survey did not request information on vertical profile grades.  
4.7.2 Recommended Guidelines  
 
Vertical Profile Grade Design Issue and Guideline Development 
 
Construction of a toll plaza at the crest of a profile grade results in sight distance 
advantages and plaza operations benefit from gravitational forces in slowing vehicles 
approaching the toll lanes and accelerating vehicles departing the plaza.  Consequently, 
some studies have recommended the use of a + 3% grade for the plaza approach and 
departure area.  Unfortunately, when the plaza’s mixed flow traffic includes commercial 
vehicles, a 3% grade will adversely affect the performance of these vehicles, resulting in 
additional delays through the plaza.  A vertical profile grade greater than or equal to + 1% 
and less than or equal to + 2% better accommodates the performance of commercial 
vehicles under the stop and go conditions normally encountered in plaza queue zones.  For 
the toll lanes, the cross slope and the vertical profile grade should be designed concurrently 
to assure proper drainage. Under no circumstances should the vertical profile grade be less 
than + 0.5% or exceed + 2% in a toll lane. This avoids the undesirable need to install 
trench or slot drains across the toll lane entrance that may clog, causing the possible unsafe 
condition (to both attendant and user) of ice formation within the lane. The canopy and 
storm drainage system design must direct collected water away from the toll lanes.

Commentary The cross slope and profile grade should be designed in conjunction to 
avoid storm drainage flows across the entrance to the toll lane. The 
canopy and storm drainage system design should direct collected water 
away from the toll lanes and help reduce precipitation within the toll 
lane. 
Guideline Vertical Profile Grade Guideline 1 
Title Plaza Approach and Departure Profile Grades 
Text In cases of mixed flow traffic, the vertical profile grade approaching 
and departing the toll plaza should be greater than or equal to + 1%

the percentage of commercial vehicles is low and the toll plaza is 
located at the crest of the profile grade.

 4.8 LIGHTING  
 
Safety hazards prevalent to a toll plaza are compounded at night and need to be mitigated 
by properly designed lighting both at the plaza approach and departure, as well as the 
conventional plaza toll lanes.  For toll plazas with express lanes, roadway divergence into a 
conventional toll plaza requires lighting equivalent to partial interchange lighting standards 
deployed at interchanges. The lighting design for the approach transition and queue zones 
must provide the level of luminance needed to identify open toll lanes and select the 
appropriate lane to transact a toll. Lighting design for manual and automatic lanes must be 
sufficient to see toll island signing, displays, traffic control equipment, and toll collection/
ticket issuing equipment. Lighting design for the departure recovery and transition zones 
must provide a smooth transition for the user departing the plaza, who must 
simultaneously accelerate and merge with other vehicles exiting the plaza before joining any 
express lane traffic on the continuing roadway lanes. Tower, high-mast, and standard pole 
and mast arm roadway lighting are used for the approach and departure zones as well as at 
the divergence of the express lanes and conventional plaza lanes. Design of the toll lane 
lighting must strive to eliminate glare and provide uniform lighting through the toll lane. 
This can be achieved using island mounted luminaries directing light upward to reflect off 
the underside of the canopy or overhead mounted luminaries directing light downward.  
 
4.8.1 State-of-the-Practice 
 
As presented in the Table below, most toll roads and toll bridges use standard pole 
and mast arms with a single luminaire to light approach and departure zones.  
However, a good percentage use high mast supports with multiple luminaires.  
Tower lighting is the least commonly used application.

zones.  High pressure sodium is the most popular.   
 
 
4.8.3 Recommended Guidelines  
 
Lighting Design Issues 
 
According to the AASHTO “Green Book”, where there are concentrations of pedestrians 
and roadside intersectional interferences, fixed-source lighting tends to reduce crashes.  The 
“Green Book” does mention that toll plazas are usually lighted.  Due to the amount of 
activity from traffic weaving, diverging, merging and stopping in the approach and 
departure zones, and the presence of fixed objects mounted in front of and to the toll 
island(s) adjacent to the toll lane, properly designed luminaries are critical to maintaining 
safety and operational efficiency through the plaza.

CHAPTER 5 
 
TOLL COLLECTION  
EQUIPMENT TECHNOLOGY 
A toll collection and revenue management system requires a variety of equipment, 
typically involving hardware and software components, to handle both front end and 
back office tasks.  Front end tasks include data collection, transaction and event 
processing and performance monitoring while back-office tasks include processing, 
storing, retrieving, reporting performance monitoring.  Only the equipment that the 
customer interfaces with or uses in some fashion is addressed below. While not all 
equipment can be strictly categorized as a traffic control device, each item can affect 
traffic flow through a toll lane if the design and/or installation are deficient.   A list 
of this equipment is the following: 
· Automatic Coin Machine (ACM), 
· Automatic Ticket Issuing Machine (ATIM), 
· Island Traffic Signal, 
· Patron Toll Display, 
· Automatic Barrier Gate, 
· Tollbooth, 
· Violation Enforcement System (VES) Cameras and Lights. 
 
5.1 ACM/ATIM TOLL EQUIPMENT DESIGN  
 
The automatic coin machine (ACM) is used in barrier plaza toll lanes where users must 
pay the indicated toll by dropping coins or tokens into the basket or hopper attached to 
the front of the ACM cabinet before exiting the lane.  The ACM then automatically 
separates and detects the denomination of the coins, and either displays the value of the 
deposited coins or tokens and/or displays a fare paid message when the correct amount 
has been deposited. The automatic ticket issuing machine (ATIM) is used exclusively in a 
closed ticket system to issue a ticket to the user at the entry points to the facility. The 
ticket commonly shows time, date, facility entry location and tolls assessed at the various 
exits ahead.  At the exit plaza, the ticket is returned to the attendant for use in 
determining the toll due, which is based on vehicle classification and distance traveled.  If 
the ticket is lost or damaged beyond recognition, subject to agency policy, the user is 
charged a toll based on entry at a plaza located furthest from the exit location.

5.1.1 State-of-the-Practice 
 
U.S. agencies historically have procured automatic coin machines manufactured by a variety 
of vendors with varying performance capabilities and features. The following list provides 
the names of some of the better known vendors in the toll industry:  
 
· Cubic Toll Systems, 
· Toller and Cooper 
· CS Route 
· Mitsubishi 
· TST 
· Intrans Group/TDC 
· Ascom Transport Systems (formerly Ascom Trindel Corp.) 
·  TransCore (TST) 
 
The industry has since experienced some consolidation and the last three companies listed 
above currently capture the largest market share of new procurements. Although electronic 
toll collection (ETC) has eroded sales of ACMs, agencies continue to purchase coin 
machines, particularly for ramp plazas, to accommodate customers without ETC 
transponders and to minimize labor costs. All automatic coin machines include a reject 
receptacle to collect foreign coins, slugs and other invalid objects tossed into the basket.  
Depending on the agency’s preference, the reject receptacle may be accessible to the 
customer to retrieve the invalid object. The ACM may also include an integral receipt 
printer and card reader to read either agency issued cards or credit cards for payment 
purposes.  Although these devices reduce throughput, the card reader can result in less 
violations, albeit small.   
 
The user is expected to drive-up next to this automated collection equipment without 
hitting the equipment with their vehicle. A more hazardous condition results when the 
vehicle stops too far from the equipment and the user either misses the basket with coins 
or tokens or is unable to reach the ticket, resulting in the user either fully or partially leaving 
their vehicle to deposit the toll or take a ticket. Given over 50% of lanes with an ACM or 
ATIM also include ETC equipment based on the survey results, a following ETC equipped 
vehicle intent on not stopping in the lane can cause a very unsafe situation for a person not 
safely buckled into their vehicle.  Consequently, proper placement and visibility of the 
equipment is important to ensure the user gets into correct position to deposit coins or 
take a ticket.

 5.1.4 Recommended Guidelines 
 
Automatic Coin Machine Design Issues:   
 
· To minimize damage to the ACM and the user’s vehicle, the front lip of the ACM 
basket or hopper should not protrude into the travel lane; 
 
· To maximize the percentage of coins or tokens tossed toward the basket and 
processed by the ACM, the circumference and height of the top of the basket 
should be specified to easily accommodate the majority of customers while 
adequately handling the remaining customers driving vehicles with height profiles 
significantly above or below the normal range; 
 
· Visibility of the ACM must be prominent relative to other features on the toll 
island so the user can quickly identify the location of the ACM and begin 
maneuvering their vehicle as early as possible to be in good position to deposit 
coins or tokens into the basket; 
 
· Provisions for a quick means of notifying customers when the correct toll has been 
deposited and counted as a valid deposit that is visible under all lighting 
conditions; 
 
· If trucks are allowed to use the ACM lane, determination of whether a dual height 
ACM is warranted to make depositing coins or tokens by truck drivers essentially 
equivalent to a passenger car drivers. The increased height of the basket is 
expected to increase the percentage of coins or tokens tossed toward the basket by 
truck drivers that are processed by the ACM and reduce  transaction time, thereby 
increasing vehicle throughput; 
· Suitability of integrating a card reader into the ACM cabinet as an alternative 
means of payment. 
 
Automatic Ticket Issuing Machine Design Issues:  
 
· To minimize damage to the ATIM and the user’s vehicle, the front edges of the 
ATIM should not protrude into the travel lane. 
 
· To minimize the difficulty in reaching and taking a ticket, the height of the ticket 
dispensing feature of the ATIM must be specified to easily accommodate the 
majority of customers while adequately handling the remaining customers driving 
vehicles with height profiles significantly above or below the normal range. 
 
· Visibility of the ATIM must be prominent relative to other features on the toll 
island so the user can quickly identify the location of the ATIM and begin 
maneuvering their vehicle as early as possible to be in good position to easily reach

and take a ticket, 
 
· If trucks are allowed to use the automatic lane, dual ATIMs, at the appropriate 
heights for passenger cars and truck, are warranted to assure both drivers can 
safely reach and take a ticket from the driver-side window.  Dual ATIMS are 
expected to reduce the transaction time, thereby increasing vehicle throughput. 
 
 
Automatic Coin Machine Guideline Development: 
 
· The front lip of the ACM basket or hopper should be approximately coincident 
with the edge of the toll island and not protrude into the travel lane. While vehicles 
with extended mirrors pose the greatest damage risk, the natural inclination of 
passenger cars drivers to avoid getting to close to a raised island or curb will 
minimize basket and vehicle damage. Installation of the ACM based on this 
location will also assure the passage of a large maintenance vehicle does not result 
in damage to the ACM. 
 
· The ACMs manufactured by current vendors locate the basket or hopper at 
approximately the same height from the bottom of the cabinet.  The basket 
circumference tends to vary among the vendors and is limited by the cabinet 
dimensions and any supported features. A telephone survey of three well 
established ACM vendors resulted in the following findings: ASCOM/Trindel 
provides a basket height of 48 inches and a circumference of 47 inches, TransCore 
provides a basket height of 39 and a circumference of 46 inches, and InTrans 
provides a basket height of 39 inches and a circumference of 57 inches. Therefore, 
the recommended guideline should be based on the median top of basket height 
and the largest of the three circumferences. 
 
· The ACM cabinet should be finished with a bright color (other than white to retain 
contrast with the attached basket material) that is distinctive of any other colors 
used in the toll lane.  Because of the reflective property and visibility of white 
materials, the basket or hopper should be manufactured using white material. 
Although ACM cabinet lighting, some in the shape of arrows to highlight where 
the deposit needs to be made, has been used to provide greater visibility, the 
additional maintenance and energy costs relative to the effectiveness of ACM 
cabinet lights must be measured.  This measurement is problematic and requires 
extensive field observation with and without the lighting. 
 
· Consistent with the 71% of agencies responding to the survey who use ACMs with 
fare displays, the ACM cabinet should include an embedded display that shows, as 
a minimum, a fare paid message and preferably displays the remaining balance to 
be deposited so the user has immediate feedback when an invalid coin or token is 
deposited.  This feedback is expected to reduce transaction times and throughput 
delays.  The fare display should be installed directly above the coin basket so the 
user can simultaneously deposit coins or tokens while viewing the display for 
feedback on the deposit.

· Although convenient to truck drivers, dual height ACMs are not commonly used 
on U.S. toll road facilities.  Reasons for the lack of dual height ACMs are the 
common exclusion of trucks from automatic lanes to avoid the additional costs 
incurred to implement a pre-classification system, automatic lanes are often  too 
narrow for safe passage by trucks, the traffic volume of trucks does not warrant 
special equipment for convenience and a marginal increase in throughput 
performance, and an increase in capital and maintenance costs. Also, violation 
enforcement system cameras can be triggered for all vehicles and front license 
plate images can be subsequently purged when the lane controller confirms the toll 
paid corresponds to the vehicle post classification.  For these reasons, dual height 
ACMs should not be implemented in automatic lanes unless daily truck volume 
through the lane exceeds 25%, a volume expected to put truck and passenger car 
generated revenue approximately on par. 
 
· Since the likelihood of a user without a transponder not having adequate change 
increases when the toll exceeds one dollar, integrating a card reader into the ACM 
provides a viable means to pay the toll in an unattended lane.  Alternative card 
types include credit cards, agency charge cards and smart cards. Agency charge 
cards and smart cards are preferable to a credit card because of bank fees (usually 
both a flat fee and a percentage of transaction fee), and the impracticality of 
obtaining a signature confirming the transaction. The primary types of card readers 
are swipe, insert, and proximity.  The performance of a swipe card reader is 
susceptible to precipitation, requires the magnetic stripe to be properly positioned 
in the reader, may require multiple swipes for a successful read and requires the 
user to be positioned within arms length of the reader to swipe the card.  An insert 
card reader requires the magnetic stripe to be properly positioned when inserted 
into the reader, may require multiple inserts for a successful read and requires the 
user to be positioned within arms length of the reader to insert the card.  A 
proximity card reader requires the card to be properly positioned in front of the 
reader for a successful read and the user needs to be positioned reasonably close to 
the reader to properly present the card.  A significant shortcoming when 
implementing a card reader at a toll facility that also provides electronic toll 
collection is the potential cannibalization of ETC transactions.  An ETC discount 
or a surcharge on a card transaction can be used to minimize the loss of ETC 
transactions.  Furthermore, based on the foregoing analysis, only a proximity card 
reader using an agency or smart card should be considered for integration into the 
ACM. 
 
Automatic Ticket Issuing Machine Guideline Development: 
 
· The front edge of the ATIM should be approximately coincident with the edge of 
the toll island and not protrude into the travel lane. However, since the ATIM is 
commonly mounted to the side of a tollbooth that may have one-foot side ledges, 
the potential for a small overhang into the lane is likely.  While vehicles with 
extended mirrors pose the greatest damage risk, the natural inclination of 
passenger cars drivers to avoid getting to close to a raised island or curb is

expected to minimize damage to the ATIM. A small overhang into the lane is not 
expected to result in a greater incident of damage due to the passage of large 
maintenance vehicles through the lane. Preferably, the front edge of the ATIM 
should be in the same vertical plane as the front face of the island curb or raised 
barrier. 
 
· The current standard for eye height within a passenger car is 3.5 feet. For trucks, 
eye heights have been found to range from 71.5 inches to 112.5 with an average 
height of 90 inches.1  Assuming a comfortable arm height at approximately 6 
inches lower, the height of the ticket dispensing component of the ATIM for 
passenger cars should be 3 feet from the toll lane pavement.  Similarly, the height 
of the ticket dispensing component of the ATIM for trucks should be 7.25 feet 
from the toll lane pavement.  This clearly shows the impractically of using a single 
height ATIM for both passenger cars and trucks. 
 
· The ATIM enclosure should be finished with a bright color that is distinctive of 
any other colors used in the automatic lane.  Although lighted arrows and other 
lighted objects have been used to highlight where the user needs to direct their 
attention to obtain a ticket, the additional maintenance and energy costs relative to 
the effectiveness of these enhancements must be measured.  This measurement is 
problematic and requires extensive field observation with and without the arrows 
or other lighted objects., Alternatively, a fixed, static sign stating “Take Ticket” 
installed above the ATIM provides an inexpensive and effective means of 
conveying what is expected of the user. 
 
· Dual height ATIMs installed at the heights suggested above are required if 
passenger cars and trucks are allowed to use the automatic lane. The majority of 
automatic lanes at existing closed ticket system facilities are restricted to passenger 
cars to maintain high throughput rates in these lanes and avoid the additional 
capital and maintenance costs associated with two (four when high availability and 
capacity are required) ATIMs.  Also, agencies that classify and encode vehicle class 
on the ticket upon entry would need to install an automated pre-classification 
system to accommodate trucks.  Automatic lanes are often too narrow for safe 
passage by trucks. Clearly, the operational policy of the agency regarding the use of 
attendants to issue tickets upon entry ultimately determines if dual height ATIMs 
can be treated as optional. Limiting entry plaza staffing to maintenance personnel 
to assure the ATIMs are stocked and operating properly is a viable option.   Based 
on this analysis, if the entry plaza is staffed with attendants, automatic lanes should 
be restricted to passenger cars using either a single ATIM or a adding a second 
(i.e., redundant) ATIM, both installed at the same height.

 5.2 ISLAND TRAFFIC SIGNAL DESIGN 
 
The island traffic signal (ITS) is used to control the flow of traffic through each 
conventional toll plaza lane, including manual, automatic and dedicated lanes.  The user is 
expected to react to the current state of the signal in the same manner as ramp metering, 
stopping at the toll collection point and exiting the lane when the signal state changes. Each 
ITS includes a minimum of two vertically aligned signal heads. Red and green signal heads 
are typically used in manual and automatic lanes and green and yellow in dedicated ETC 
lanes. In lanes that provide an electronic toll collection (ETC) capability, the familiar yellow 
signal head is sometimes added to the ITS to provide ETC user feedback on the status of 
their account, specifically an account balance that requires payment or replenishment. 
Another common feature of the ITS is the mounting of an alarm and flashing light to the 
top of the ITS assembly, both of which are activated when a violation occurs.  For plaza 
lanes installed with violation enforcement equipment, this feature is either not installed or 
not used.   
 
5.2.1 State-of-the-Practice 
 
The ITS is invariably mounted to a pedestal located downstream of the toll collection point 
and installed with the intent of being equally visible to passenger car and truck users.  The 
signal head has evolved from an incandescent lamp installed behind an 8 inch or 12 inch 
colored lens to an 8 inch or 12 inch LED signal head.  The lens has commonly been  
stenciled with the words “Thank you” and “Stop” corresponding to the green and red 
signal heads, respectively. When used to display ETC account information, “Low Balance” 
or “Call CSC” has been stenciled to the lens of the yellow signal head.  The stenciling 
requires additional maintenance man hours to install, while the perceived benefit to the 
user is questionable.  Some agencies deploy signals with square heads or other unique 
shapes that are equally effective in controlling flow through the lane and conveying 
information to the user, but at a higher replacement cost, longer lead time for procuring 
spares and non-compliance with the MUTCD.

 Island Traffic Signal Design Issues 
 
The diameter of signal head used to assemble the ITS must be selected to be consistent in 
scale and form with other toll lane equipment such as the patron fare display, and be clearly 
visible to approaching passenger car and truck traffic without excessive brightness, and 
provide the most economical solution relative to capital and maintenance costs. 
 
The location of the ITS must be selected to assure visibility to approaching passenger car 
and truck traffic while preventing the displayed signal state intended for the paid exiting 
vehicle to also be viewed and interpreted as the correct state for a following  vehicle 
approaching or at the toll collection point. The implementation of ETC capability in the 
lane increases the potential for confusion because the majority of time a leading ETC 
equipped vehicle will receive a quick green signal allowing an immediate exit from the lane 
but potentially leaving the green signal in full view for the following vehicle that is not ETC 
equipped. 
 
The location of the ITS is constrained by the physical features of the toll island, such as the 
size and shape of tollbooth and columns supporting the canopy as well as the length of 
departure end of the toll island.  Similarly, the location of other toll collection equipment, 
particularly a patron toll display and an automatic barrier gate, limit locations available for 
installing the ITS. 
 
Adequate horizontal clearance from the vertical face of the toll island or raised barrier must 
be provided to avoid damage from passing vehicles. 
 
Similar to the location of the ITS, the height of the ITS also needs to be designed to assure 
visibility to approaching passenger car and truck traffic. 
 
Island Traffic Signal Guideline Development: 
 
The two most common diameters used for traffic signal heads are 12 inches and 8 inches. 
Consistent with the survey results, the 8-inch diameter signal is predominantly used in 
existing agency toll lanes.  This diameter uses less of the limited toll island space and is 
more consistent in scale and form with the patron fare display, thereby avoiding 
domination of the user’s focus upon entering the toll lane.  Of the two types of traffic 
signal heads that can be installed in a toll lane, LED or incandescent lamp, the LED signal 
clearly has a lower life cycle cost based on energy consumption and lamp replacement 
costs. Because the LED signal head provides significantly higher nighttime intensity relative 
to a lamp signal head it may be deemed undesirable.  However, toll lane lighting can be 
designed to mitigate the high intensity affects of the LED signal heads. 
 
The location of the ITS on the toll island is first dependent on the location of any canopy 
column and any automatic barrier gate. The next consideration is installing the ITS in a 
location where the window of time that the ITS is within full view of an exiting vehicle is 
balanced with the ability to display the intended signal state to the following vehicle before 
the vehicle reaches the toll collection point. Assuming an arming or presence loop is 
installed at the toll collection point, a practical solution is one that uses the falling signal

from the trailing edge of the loop, effectively functioning as a trigger to the lane software to 
change the state of the ITS.  Based on this analysis, the ITS should be installed approximately 15 
feet beyond the downstream edge of the loop, assuming 15 feet represents the detection length 
of a typical vehicle and there are no physical constraints to this location. Visibility issues with the 
ITS can primarily be resolved by selecting the optimum height of the assembly for viewing by 
both passenger car and truck users. Although not preferred or recommended, some agencies 
combine the ITS and automatic barrier gate cabinet or install the ITS immediately behind the 
cabinet.  Separate installations, with the ITS installed in front of the gate, avoids the potential 
temporary loss of both components resulting from a vehicle collision and ITS visibility loss from 
a raised gate arm. 
 
With 6-18 inches representing a conservative range for horizontal clearance from the travelway 
used within the toll industry, a recommended clearance of 12 inches provides the same protec-
tion afforded the tollbooth for a location where the vehicle is expected to have maneuvered to 
the center of the lane in the course of exiting the plaza. 
 
The height of the ITS should be uniform for all toll lanes to minimize pedestal spare parts or the 
need to custom cut pedestals. The survey results indicate a predominant height of approximately 
4 to 5 feet.  This height is expected to assure visibility to approaching passenger car and truck 
traffic under most conditions.

  5.3 PATRON TOLL DISPLAY DESIGN  
 
The patron toll or fare display is traffic control equipment consisting of a changeable 
alphanumeric sign mounted to a stanchion that is used to show the assessed toll based on 
the classification of the vehicle. Vehicle classification is entered by the attendant based on 
counted axles for each vehicle and the associated toll is established by an agency board 
and displayed on a rate schedule sign normally located off the side of the conventional 
toll plaza.  Other vehicle characteristics used to establish vehicle classification are weight, 
vertical profile (i.e., height) and horizontal profile (i.e., width and length), either sepa-
rately or combined.  A PTD in an automatic lane is commonly used to show the user the 
remaining toll balance that is decremented after each valid coin is deposited into the 
ACM.  The PTD is also used to convey completion of the transaction by displaying a 
“fare paid” message, which should display simultaneously with the state of an island traf-
fic signal (ITS) changing from red to green. The PTD can also be used to display ETC 
account status messages such as “Acct Low”, “E-ZPass Go”, and “Call CSC”. The pa-
tron toll or fare display can pose a safety hazard if mounted to close to the travelway.  
Conversely, the PTD can have a beneficial  affect on operational performance (e.g., im-
proved plaza throughput) if accurate and timely information is displayed to the user dur-
ing a transaction.  
 
5.3.1 State-of-the-Practice 
 
Of the various PTD display technologies used to convey messages to the user, the fol-
lowing are three of the most common:

· LED 
· Fiber optic flip disk 
 
Based on the survey results, the LED displays have displaced the mainstay fluorescent 
flip disk as the most popular PTD technology.  Since energy efficiency offered by LED 
and fluorescent flip disk are expected to be comparable, clarity of display, vendor prod-
uct offerings, and maintenance considerations are likely the primary factors favoring the 
LED display.

5.3.4 Recommended Guidelines 
Patron Toll Display Design Issues  
 
· For manual lanes, the patron toll display can be attached to the side of the tollbooth if 
adequate horizontal clearance is available to prevent overhang into the travel lane.  
Alternatively, the PTD can be mounted to the top of a pedestal that is installed on the 
toll island very close to the tollbooth while maintaining adequate horizontal clearance 
with the front face of the toll island or raised barrier and not blocking attendant access 
ways. 
 
· For ACM lanes, the PTD or patron fare display (PFD) is commonly an integral part of 
the ACM cabinet that is installed above the basket or hopper. However, some agencies 
use a standalone PFD or PTD, either in addition to or in lieu of one built into the 
ACM.  The presence of an ETC capability in the lane supports the need for a display 
providing a better viewing angle for ETC users who normally bypass the ACM while 
traveling through the lane, subject to the status of the traffic devices controlling flow. 
The standalone PFD must be installed in a location that is easily seen after entering the

ETC read zone so that the user is prepared to stop at the ACM if a message such as  
“deposit $ X.XX” is displayed instead of  “Fare Paid”.  For ATIM lanes, since an 
alpha-only sign is needed, a blankout sign capable of one or two alpha-only messages, 
such as “Take Ticket” and “Out of Service” (in the case of two equal height ATIMS), 
is better suited to meeting the particular needs of this lane type. 
 
· For dedicated lanes, the ITS alone can provide ETC account status using green and 
yellow, or some other easily recognizable lens color for the signal heads.  Therefore, 
since a valid ETC transaction or a violation are the only transactions possible, neither 
of which require any user involvement when traveling through the lane, a PTD in these 
lanes is not warranted. This reduces the agency’s capital and system maintenance costs 
and equipment clutter that can confuse users. 
 
· The height of the PTD must be selected to assure the sign can be seen by all vehicle 
traffic using a particular toll plaza lane type. 
 
Patron Toll Display Guideline Development: 
 
· The dimensions of the PTD must be consistent with the messages intended to be 
displayed and result in a size that is: 1) consistent in scale and form of other toll lane 
equipment such as the ITS; 2) be installed at an angle that is clearly visible to 
approaching passenger car and truck traffic; 3) provide a minimum 12 inch horizontal 
clearance setback from the toll island curb or face of raised barrier; and 4) provide the 
most economical solution relative to capital and maintenance costs. Since the PTD in 
manual lanes is commonly mounted to the side of the tollbooth, installing the PTD at 
an angle is usually not done (see Exhibit 5-4).  The size of the characters used in the 
message tend vary within a small range of 3 inches high, which has proven to be a 
legible size from the distances the display is expected to be read by the user. 
 
· In manual/attended lanes, the location of the PTD must be selected as close to the 
tollbooth as the size and any toll island access-ways permit to assure visibility to toll-
paying passenger car and truck traffic. The location of the PTD is constrained by the 
physical features of the toll island, such as the size of tollbooth and columns 
supporting the canopy as well as the distance to the ITS, which should always be 
located downstream of the PTD. In automatic lanes, the PTD should be located just 
downstream and within three (3) to eight (8) feet of the ACM, without blocking an 
existing or planned accessway. 
 
· In manual collection lanes, the height of the PTD needs to be selected so that it can be 
seen by all vehicles classes.  The optimum viewing  height should be set for the 
predominant vehicle class, which is a two-axle passenger car. However, consideration 
must be given to the extent to which passenger cars are the primary users of the ETC 
dedicated and express lanes (if any) and thereby less likely to use a manual collection 
lane. As a result, the PTD height should be optimized for view by drivers of SUVs and 
light trucks, resulting in more equal, albeit opposite, viewing angles for both truck and 
passenger car drivers.  Given ETC dedicated and express lanes are expected to expand 
over time, the higher viewing height of the PTD is warranted even if the initial truck 
volumes are low.

Title PTD Horizontal Clearance 
Text Provide a minimum 12 inch horizontal clearance setback from the toll island 
curb or face of raised barrier. 
Commentary None. 
The ability of an ETC accountholder who fails to obtain a valid ETC transaction in a 
manual lane to quickly maneuver their vehicle to the booth to pay the attendant is 
dependent on the width of the toll lane, the vehicles lateral/transverse position in the lane 
and the driver’s longitudinal location when the PTD’s stop pay toll message is noticed. 
Since the ETC antenna is commonly installed just before the tollbooth door to minimize 
the software complications of handling RF signal reflections, the driver must be watching 
the PTD to react quickly enough to be in position to pay a toll.  The ETC accountholder 
may put their vehicle in reverse to get into a position to pay the attendant. This creates a 
very unsafe situation.  The two recommended solutions, in the order listed, for handling 
this problem are to 1) move the antenna location upstream if the software can support this 
location; 2) add VES equipment (i.e., front and rear cameras if necessary) to the lane to 
capture the vehicle’s license plate and modify the software to provide a green light if a 
transponder Agency Code is read, regardless of account status. The PTD would only 
display a toll due message.

 5.4 AUTOMATIC BARRIER GATE DESIGN  
 
An automatic barrier gate is traffic control equipment that is primarily used for violation 
enforcement by blocking traffic from exiting the lane until the toll due is paid.  In manual 
and automatic lanes equipped for ETC, gates are also used to reduce the speed of ETC 
traffic for the safety of attendants who must walk across plaza lanes. The gate is 
comprised of a cabinet containing a gate motor, controller interface, gate arm support 
assembly and gate arm. Upon a fare being paid, the lane subsystem transmits a signal to 
the gate controller that energizes the motor to automatically raise the gate arm from a 
horizontal position to a vertical position, thereby releasing the paid vehicle.  The gate arm 
is returned to a horizontal positions after the exiting vehicle is no longer detected by one 
or more detection devices installed adjacent to the barrier gate and connected to either the 
gate controller or lane controller. 
 
5.4.1 State-of-the-Practice 
 
Agencies historically have used automatic barrier gates from several suppliers offering 
machines with differing gate arm speeds and reliabilities and used in both toll plaza and 
parking applications. Magnetek, a German manufacturer, has gained a majority share of 
the toll industry’s barrier gate market primarily because of superior performance in gate 
speed and reliability. Their high reliability is the result of minimizing the number of 
moveable parts comprising the gate assembly. Vehicle detection equipment is invariably 
used in conjunction with the automatic barrier gate to prevent the gate arm from lowering 
when a vehicle is present.

5.4.4  Recommended Guidelines 
Automatic Barrier Gate Design Issues  
 
· While the automatic barrier gate has historically been effective in discouraging 
violations, particularly in manual lanes, gates installed in automatic lanes can be 
problematic during ACM malfunctions and when the user fails to pay the toll. Each 
of these conditions requires quick identification of the problem and raising the gate 
remotely or on-site by a lane walker to release the user waiting to exit the lane.  
Remote rising of the gate is usually done from the nearest attended tollbooth or the 
toll plaza administration building.  This results in vehicle processing delays and often 
causes longer plaza lane queues that increase the incident of unsafe lane changing. 
This problem is compounded if vehicle identification information is manually 
collected prior to releasing the vehicle. 
 
· Although the automatic barrier gate technology has improved over the years, such as 
the reduction of moving parts, equipment malfunction periodically occurs. This 
condition first requires identification of the problem by either an attendant in the 
lanes, an on-site maintenance technician or the plaza supervisor stationed in the 
operations room of the toll plaza administration building. After manually locking the 
gate arm in an open position and clearing the lane, the agency can either close the 
lane or continue to operate with an open gate until operation of the gate is restored. 
As a minimum, this process causes processing delays resulting in longer plaza lane 
queues that increase the incident of unsafe lane changing. If the maintenance staff 
response to this malfunction is slow, the impact on plaza throughput and safe 
operations can be significant. 
 
· In automatic lanes, the failure of the gate arm to rise to release a waiting vehicle 
because of a malfunction of the ACM or gate or a failure to pay the toll, may result in 
a broken gate arm when an impatient user is unwilling to continue waiting for an 
extended time period and breaks-off the gate arm.  Depending on the extent of 
damage to the gate and the availability of spare gate arms, the time required to 
restore the lane could be significant.  Temporarily closing the lane in lieu of operating 
without the benefit of a gate during high traffic periods will likely result in increased 
lane changes and longer queues resulting from a reduction in plaza throughput. 
 
· The automatic barrier gate cabinet must be installed either a safe distance from the 
toll lane travelway and/or behind the front face of a toll island or raised barrier to 
avoid damage from passing vehicles. The length of the gate arm when in a horizontal 
(i.e., closed) position must be visible to all vehicles allowed to use the lane where it is 
installed. 
 
· Since the majority of vendor furnished standard gate arms lengths are eight (8) and 
ten (10) feet, the selected arm length and setback from the travelway may leave a gap 
sufficient for passage of a motorcycle when the arm is in the closed position.

 Automatic Barrier Gate Guideline Development: 
 
· Toll plazas configured with dedicated and/or express lanes are very likely to include 
violation enforcement equipment, such as cameras and image processors that capture 
license plate images of violating vehicles.  Consequently, VES equipment can easily be 
installed in automatic lanes, particularly if these lanes also include ETC equipment, to 
capture the plates of users who fail to pay the toll due.  Although violations in the 
manual lanes of plazas that offer multiple collection mode lanes are usually minimal, 
VES equipment can also be deployed to capture the license plate of violators in these 
lanes.  The remaining benefit derived from barrier gates, specifically, reducing speed in 
lanes attendants must cross to safely get to their assigned tollbooth, is dependent on 
whether these lanes actually have a vehicle speed problem. 
 
· Based on the above issues related to the installation of automatic barrier gates as well 
as the annual costs to maintain and repair the gates, automatic barrier gates should only 
be considered for installation in plazas that include ETC equipment when the 
attendant must cross more than one lane to safely reach their tollbooth.  In plazas that 
do not include an ETC capability, gates are recommended for use in automatic lanes 
when there is an adjacent manual lane in addition to the plaza supervisor’s workstation 
functionality, to remotely open the gate.  For toll island installation, the gate cabinet 
should be setback 12 inches from the face of the toll island or raised barrier.  
 
· Under all circumstances, a ten (10) foot gate arm should be used to minimize the end 
gap within the toll lane without materially slowing the gate arm speed and to increase 
visibility of the arm to approaching vehicles.  To further increase visibility, the gate arm 
finish should be striped using two distinct, contrasting colors.  A breakaway gate arm 
assembly should be specified to minimize repair time when a vehicle collides with a 
gate arm.

Title Provisions for Automatic Lane Barrier Gates in Toll Plaza Deploying VES 
Equipment 
Text VES equipment should be used in lieu of automatic barrier gates unless vehicle 
speeds through the automatic lane pose a safety hazard to attendants who must 
cross more than one lane. 
Commentary  To avoid the revenue loss from opening the gate for customers who fail to fully 
pay the displayed toll, plus the operational costs incurred to assure the gate arm 
raises and to maintain the gates, VES equipment should be deployed instead of 
automatic barrier gates. The automatic barrier gate installed at the departure end 
of the toll island to control the flow of traffic  through a lane should not be 
confused with a pedestrian gate installed on the toll island to prevent staff or 
visitors from walking into a toll lane.   This particular gate is rarely automated.

 5.5   TOLLBOOTH DESIGN 
 
The tollbooth is used in manual collection lanes to protect the attendant and collection 
equipment from both weather conditions and users who maneuver their vehicles 
unreasonably close to the tollbooth to pay the toll and receive change and a receipt.  The 
dimensions of tollbooths installed in conventional toll plazas vary considerably.  In nearly 
all instances, the tollbooth is installed on an elevated toll island that extends beyond the 
outside width of the tollbooth, providing horizontal clearance on each side with the 
expectation of avoiding damage to the booth and vehicles.  Safety and operational issues 
related to the user’s interaction with the tollbooth is limited primarily to horizontal 
clearance and protection of the attendant from errant vehicles in maneuvering toward the 
tollbooth to pay the attendant. Manual lanes deploying ETC equipment pose the most 
significant safety concern resulting from the user not recognizing a failed ETC 
transaction until the vehicle is downstream of the tollbooth.     
5.5.1 State-of-the-Practice 
 
New facilities are commonly using prefabricated tollbooths constructed of stainless steel 
sheets and tubular structural steel framing that are shipped to the toll plaza for 
installation.  The equipment installed inside the tollbooth may include a toll terminal for 
entering vehicle class, fare paid or an unusual condition, a receipt printer, a badge reader 
for accessing the system, a ticket validator and stacker for validating and storing tickets 
and various security devices. The tollbooth typically includes a dutch door or sliding 
window to keep the attendant within the booth while providing a large opening for 
reaching up and down to exchange money. Some tollbooth designs provide the 
equivalent of a small “porch” consisting of short walls extending from the side of the 
booth and intended to make vehicle contact with the booth much less likely. This 
assumes the height of the “porch” walls is below extended mirrors and other 
overhanging apparatus.  Although the tollbooth cannot be strictly construed as traffic 
control equipment, the time to complete a transaction provides a metering affect on 
plaza traffic throughput. The tollbooth design needs to address both the safety of the 
collector and the user as they interact along the toll lane.

 5.5.3  Recommended Guidelines 
 
Tollbooth Design Issues 
 
· The tollbooth horizontal clearance from the face of the toll island curb or a raised 
barrier must accommodate easy exchange of money between attendant and user for all 
vehicles types including motorcycles while also avoiding contact with any vehicle, 
vehicle cargo, or vehicle attachment as it maneuvers to come within arms reach of the 
attendant. 
 
· The combined height of the toll island and tollbooth floor tends to improve servicing 
drivers of high cab trucks and worsen the ability to exchange money with low profile 
sports cars. For obvious safety reasons, the attendant should not stray from the booth 
to service any vehicle. 
 
· Policy provisions for the attendant to enter the toll lane when safe to retrieve dropped 
money or other valuables that minimizes the time the attendant is outside the 
tollbooth. 
 
· The appropriateness of using bollards in advance of the tollbooth that may partially 
block the vision of the attendant, degrade the aesthetics of the plaza and possibly 
discourage drivers from positioning their vehicle, particularly those with extended 
mirrors or other overhanging apparatus, close enough to the booth to complete a 
transaction. 
 
· For manual collection lanes providing an ETC capability, the ability of a driver of an 
ETC equipped vehicle that fails to record a valid ETC transaction to be able to quickly 
maneuver their vehicle into position to pay the attendant before exiting the lane. 
 
 
Tollbooth Guideline Development: 
 
· The horizontal clearance from the face of the toll island curb or raised barrier to the 
side of the tollbooth from where the attendant collects tolls must allow the exchange 
of money and receipts with drivers of all vehicle types while also providing sufficient 
separation to avoid having the vehicle come into contact with the booth. Recently 
constructed toll facilities have commonly used a 12 inch horizontal clearance with good 
results. Clearances closer to 18 inches and 6 inches, considered practical upper and 
lower limits, respectively, may be equally effective.  However, clearances closer to 18 
inches makes exchanges for attendants of smaller stature more difficult for servicing 
trucks and those closer to 6 inches may unnecessarily increase the likelihood of damage 
to the tollbooth. Therefore, a nominal 12 inch is the recommended for horizontal 
clearance.

· The combined height of the toll island and tollbooth floor above the toll lane 
pavement surface primarily works to the detriment of the attendant in servicing low 
profile sports cars.  The height of the tollbooth floor above the toll island surface 
should be mitigated by constructing a blockout in the concrete island to accommodate 
both a wireway for cables and any ducts plus the depth of the tollbooth floor. 
Consequently the height of the tollbooth floor above the toll island surface is limited to 
the thickness of a rubber mat or pad that is commonly used in tollbooths. 
 
· On occasion the attendant needs to leave the tollbooth to retrieve dropped money or 
other valuables from the toll lane.  Although agency policy may require the attendant to 
close the lane before leaving the booth and walking into the lane, in cases where strict 
adherence is not enforced or no related policy exists, the tollbooth design must provide 
quick and easy access to the toll lane for both safety and operational considerations. A 
tollbooth invariably provides two doors, typically in opposing walls, for the attendant 
to have an escape route if one of the doors becomes blocked. Clearly, access to the 
lane from the door that is opened to exchange money and receipts provides the 
quickest path to the lane.  This is easily accommodated for a booth design 
incorporating just a sliding dutch door at the front of the booth. For a booth design 
that also incorporates a low height wall forming a “porch” that extends a very short 
distance from the side of the booth, the front of this wall must open and close. The 
recommended tollbooth design includes a front door that 1) allows the attendant to 
service all vehicle types while providing protection against straying into the lane; and 2) 
provides a means for the attendant to quickly enter the lane and then return to the 
booth, when traffic conditions permit. 
 
· Vehicles with extended mirrors and other apparatus or objects protruding from the 
side of the vehicle can easily damage the tollbooth and possibly injure the attendant as 
the vehicle maneuvers to pull up close to the booth and then departs without pulling 
away until further down the lane. This problem has been addressed by some agencies 
by the installation of near booth height bollards in front of the tollbooth and with the 
same horizontal clearance as the tollbooth to the lane. Given the operational 
shortcomings of trying to control the path of the vehicle in the toll lane, bollards are 
likely the least obtrusive solution available. However, the issues with using bollards as 
identified above are not easily mitigated. A near booth height bollard installed in front 
of the tollbooth will partially block the vision of the attendant at some angle of view.  
Some agencies have installed lower height bollards that do not extend above the 
bottom sill of the to tollbooth window. While these bollards cannot protect the booth 
from extended mirrors and other objects protruding from the side of trucks, a limited 
amount of booth protection from errant vehicles is provided.   To assure high visibility 
the bollards must be painted a distinctive color, which effectively highlights a feature 
that can only be viewed as an eyesore that negatively impacts plaza aesthetics. The 
distinctive colored bollard will also attract the attention of approaching vehicles that 
will be less inclined to maneuver to close to the booth to avoid coming into contact 
with the bollard. For the vehicles the bollards are primarily intended to protect against, 
the distance between the vehicle and the booth may make it difficult for the attendant 
to safely handle the transaction. Based on these shortcomings, the use of bollards to

protect the tollbooth is not recommended.  Use of the proper horizontal clearance 
should be used to protect the tollbooth from passing vehicles and ramparts and mass 
concrete formations, such as platters, should be used to protect the booth and 
attendant from errant vehicles.  For existing installations with insufficient horizontal 
clearance, bollards may provide the best means for protecting the booth and attendant 
as well as toll equipment after consideration of all reasonable alternatives. 
 
· The ability of an ETC accountholder who fails to obtain a valid ETC transaction in a 
manual lane to quickly maneuver their vehicle to the booth to pay the attendant is 
dependent on the width of the toll lane, the vehicles lateral/transverse position in the 
lane and the driver’s longitudinal location when the PTD’s stop pay toll message is 
noticed. Since the ETC antenna is commonly installed just before the tollbooth door to 
minimize the software complications of handling RF signal reflections, the driver must 
be watching the PTD to react quickly enough to be in position to pay a toll.  The ETC 
accountholder may put their vehicle in reverse to get into a position to pay the 
attendant. This creates a very unsafe situation.  The two recommended solutions, in the 
order listed, for handling this problem are to 1) move the antenna location upstream if 
the software can support this location; 2) add VES equipment (i.e., front and rear 
cameras if necessary) to the lane to capture the vehicle’s license plate and modify the 
software to provide a green light if a transponder Agency Code is read, regardless of 
account status. The PTD would only display a toll due message.

5.6 VES DESIGN 
 
The implementation of ETC in toll plaza dedicated and express lanes gave rise to the need 
for a reliable and automated means of identifying violators and mailing legally enforceable 
citations levying a fine or a fee. This was achieved by deploying cameras and supplemental 
lighting in the toll lanes to capture the license plate and, in some instances, the rear view of 
the vehicle.  The cameras and lights are mounted either overhead or along the side of the 
toll lane or roadway. Only cameras mounted on the side and adjacent to the toll lane pose a 
safety hazard if installed to close to travelway.  Conversely, lights mounted either overhead 
or along the side of a toll lane or roadside can impair the vision of motorists, resulting in a 
single or multi-car accident. Early implementations relied almost exclusively on cameras 
and lights installed to capture only the rear license plate.  This approach proved to be 
ineffective in identifying the owner of commercial vehicles, since the trailer being hauled 
may belong to a third party who should not be responsible for the driver’s violation.  
Consequently, current VES deployments are including both rear and front license plate 
image capture equipment,  including cameras and supplemental lighting.    
 
5.6.1 State-of-the-Practice 
 
Early violation enforcement system (VES) implementations relied on high resolution CCD 
cameras with moderately high shutter speed and supplemented by high intensity, 
continuously-on lighting, effectively equivalent to flood lighting. The technology has 
evolved to progressive scan cameras that capture a full instead of partial image frame and 
are capable of very high shutter speed to handle higher vehicle speeds.  
 
The majority of vendors are now implementing pulsed or flashed, high intensity LED 
white lighting and infrared lighting, although some implementations measure ambient 
lighting and supplement with continuous lighting as needed to successfully perform optical 
character recognition on the captured image. Cameras can be mounted either overhead or 
along the side of the toll lane(s).  Only when the camera is mounted on a toll island or top 
of a concrete barrier does it pose potential safety and operational concerns, particularly 
when visible to the user.  If the camera is visible, regardless of location, the user may 
maneuver their vehicle in an unsafe manner in an attempt to avoid the capture of their 
license plate, subject to physical constraints preventing such action. Similarly, supplemental 
lighting can be mounted either overhead or along the side of the toll lane(s).  However, for 
supplemental lighting both mounting locations pose potential safety and operational 
concerns.

 5.6.4 Recommended Guidelines 
VES Design Issues 
 
· For VES cameras installed on a stanchion and mounted to the toll island or the top of 
a barrier, adequate horizontal clearance from the vertical face of the toll island curb or 
travelway, respectively, must be provided to avoid damage from passing vehicles. 
 
· For supplemental lighting that is not an integral part of the camera assembly and is 
installed on a stanchion and mounted to the toll island or the top of a barrier, adequate 
horizontal clearance from the vertical face of the toll island curb or travelway, 
respectively, must be provided to avoid damage from passing vehicles. 
 
· Mounting the camera on the toll island or to the top of a concrete barrier where 
visibility to passing motorists is high, the incidence of unsafe evasive moves by 
violators to avoid detection is expected to be higher. 
 
· Supplemental lighting mounted at the approach and departure end of the toll island for 
rear and front license plate image capture, respectively, must not blind or impair the 
vision of the motorist when passing through a toll lane. 
 
· Supplemental lighting mounted overhead at the approach and departure ends of the 
toll island below must not blind or impair the vision of the motorist when passing 
through the toll lane. 
 
 
VES Guideline Development: 
 
· To limit the number of camera lenses deployed and stored as spares to an absolute 
minimum, a toll island mounting location and associated image capture trigger distance 
that applies to all plaza lanes for both approach and departure cameras must be found.  
Since it is common for alternate toll islands to have canopy column supports and 
tunnel stairwells and for tollbooths to be protected by ramparts and concrete structures 
(e.g., crash blocks, planters), finding a common image capture trigger distance can be 
problematic.  Once a common distance is found, a camera mounting angle within the 
vendor specified range of image capture angles must be selected that results in a high 
success rate of license plate optical character recognition.  This angle effectively 
determines the camera mounting location on the toll island.  Using the same guideline 
development logic that was used for the island traffic signal, a minimum horizontal 
clearance of 12 inches from the vertical face of the toll island curb should be 
maintained. 
 
· When concrete barrier is installed along the lane, the camera can either be installed on 
a stanchion mounted behind the barrier or mounted to the top or the barrier if it is a 
 
 
 183

N
 
minimum of 12 inches from the travelway.  Increasing the horizontal clearance may be 
warranted to accommodate an agency’s roadway maintenance operations and vehicles. 
 
· Vendor solutions for assuring toll facility users are not blinded or have their vision 
impaired by supplemental lighting used to improve the quality of captured license plate 
images vary from triggered pulsed/flashed or strobe lighting, infrared lighting 
(continuous and triggered), continuous white lighting with filters and diffusers/baffles, 
and continuous concentrated white directional lighting.  Pulsed or flashed lighting 
usually involves high intensity LEDs producing white lighting that is best suited to 
handling multiple colored license plate characters and backgrounds corresponding to 
different jurisdictions. The millisecond flashes for pulsed and strobe lighting that are 
only triggered when a violation is detected are intended to be unnoticeable by the user.  
Supplemental lighting is always installed either adjacent to a camera or combined with a 
camera into a single unit of equipment.  For cameras mounted to a stanchion and 
installed on a toll island, the lighting is either mounted to the same stanchion or 
separately on another stanchion. All of the lighting alternatives listed above can be used 
for both front and rear license plate image capture when deployed on a toll island or 
barrier.  For cameras mounted overhead, continuous white lighting, even with the use 
of filters and diffusers, is likely to cause visual impairment to the user when passing 
through a toll lane.  Triggered lighting using a reliable and accurate trigger should 
assure the light is not energized when a vehicle’s windshield and light rays from the 
installed supplemental lighting intersect.  While the user is far less susceptible to vision 
impairment from rear license plate overhead lighting (i.e., continuous white lighting), 
empirically supported by a number of agencies that have deployed and are still using 
continuous white lighting for rear capture, front license plate lighting must dictate the 
type of lighting used system-wide. Using the same light source assures the following: 1) 
consistency in the quality of all images captured and processed by a violation 
processing system; 2) less spares and corresponding storage space; and 3) less time 
needed to repair or replace due to technician familiarity. If only rear license plate image 
capture is to be deployed, continuous lighting should only be considered if the VES 
supplier can demonstrate superior image quality and consistency using continuous 
white lighting.  Otherwise the disadvantages of continuous lighting, namely user vision 
impairment when using the rear view mirror, and incurring significantly higher utility 
and lamp replacement costs, are expected to exceed the identified benefits.  From a 
safety and operational perspective, it is recommended continuous white lighting of 
front license plates not be deployed when mounted overhead.

6.2.1 Plaza Locations 
Guideline Plaza Locations Guideline 1 
Title Plaza and Interchange Intervals 
Text The 2001 AASHTO Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and 
Streets (the “Green Book”) recommends separation of 1 mile (urban 
sections) or 2 miles (rural sections) between interchanges.  It is 
recommended this be used as a guideline for selection of new mainline 
toll plaza sites: no closer than 1 mile to the nearest interchange in urban 
sections, or 2 miles in other sections. 
Commentary It may not be possible to meet this design guideline at bridge and tunnel 
crossings, but the interval spacing minimums should remain a goal.

while driving at posted speeds with adequate stopping distance before the queuing 
zone.  Ideally the plaza site will be on a tangent pavement section. 
Commentary None. 
Guideline Plaza Locations Guideline 3 
Title Ramp Plaza Movements 
Text New toll plazas should not have merging or exiting movements within the plaza 
approach and departure zones.  New plaza construction should not be located 
within trumpet interchange areas if at all possible.  
Commentary Some older toll plaza locations have merging and exiting movements 
within their plaza approach and departure zones.  Other appropriate 
treatment options could be applied to improve their operations.

6.2.2 Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) Dedicated Lane 
 
 
 
 
 
Guideline ETC Dedicated Lane Guideline 1 
Title ETC Dedicated Lane Count 
Text In new construction, in locations where express lanes are not feasible, the 
number of dedicated lanes should equal or exceed the number of approach 
roadway lanes or the total roadway design volume / 1,500. 
Commentary This provision almost assures that a given toll plaza will no longer 
require future modifications or lane conversions to meet 
customer demand for non-stop lanes. 
In theory, it could be appropriate to not provide dedicated lanes 
for new toll plaza construction, and instead rely on mixed-use 
lanes until ETC participation increases to levels required to fully 
use dedicated lanes.  
In practice, all major new toll roads rely heavily on non-stop ETC 
to be publicly acceptable.  This is because the provision of non-
stop toll collection is typically a requirement to “sell” the project 
to the public. 
Guideline ETC Dedicated Lane Guideline 2 
Title ETC Dedicated Lane Orientation – Mainline Toll Plazas 
Text Where possible, all payment type lanes should be clustered.  On mainline 
plazas, dedicated lanes should be clustered to the left as vehicles approach the 
plaza. 
Commentary Exceptions may be warranted when interchange ramps are in the 
approach or departure zones, or high volumes of commercial 
traffic are present.  In these conditions, a supplemental dedicated 
lane towards the right of the plaza, to support traffic entering or 
exiting the system, or to isolate ETC commercial vehicles from 
the large volumes of commuter traffic in the left dedicated lanes, 
may be warranted.

The conversion of cash toll collection lanes into dedicated lanes at 
ramp plazas has been challenging, particularly for ticket system 
operators which have plazas located close to at least two merges and 
splits in trumpet interchanges.  Dedicated lane selection must be 
made based on traffic characteristics of the individual toll operator.  
The New York Thruway, for example, often uses center lanes in 
these plazas for dedicated lanes, as this allows a single dedicated lane 
to serve traffic departing the plaza area to the left or the right 
without weaving. 
Guideline ETC Dedicated Lane Guideline 4 
Title Directional Separation of Traffic – Mainline Toll Plazas 
Text As mainline plazas are upgraded with ETC dedicated lanes, opposing 
directions of traffic should be separated by permanent barrier, or 
moveable barrier for reversible lanes, that is capable of absorbing the 
impact of a vehicle with limited movement and deflection, except 
where the separation between opposing directions equals or exceeds 
the AASHTO guidelines on highway clear zone. 
Commentary As ETC participation climbs above 50%, the need for reversible toll 
lanes lessens in most locations other than those with reversible 
mainline lanes.  Permanent barrier is expected to assist the driver in 
navigating the plaza.  Also, the task of moving cones to shift plaza 
centerlines is a dangerous field assignment, and with increasing driver 
speeds is becoming more dangerous.  Notwithstanding the use of 
rigidly followed safety procedures when visibility is good, this practice 
should be discontinued as soon as it is feasible. 
For major bridge and tunnel crossings, where significant reversible 
lane or contra-flow traffic operations are used, the use of moveable 
concrete barrier could be considered if the expense is warranted.  
When available, a clear zone between opposing traffic directions 
provides an open area (i.e., no obstacles present) considered sufficient 
for a driver to regain control of the vehicle and avoid a collision.

Guideline ETC Dedicated Lane Guideline 5 
Title ETC Dedicated Lane Widths 
Text Twelve feet (3.6m) is the recommended width for dedicated lanes that 
allow commercial vehicles (CV).  For dedicated lanes that only allow 
passenger cars, 11 feet (3.4m) is the recommended minimum width. 
Commentary Retrofits of existing plazas may deviate from these guidelines, but the 
designer needs to consider expected operating speed and protection of 
adjacent obstacles. 
Guideline ETC Dedicated Lane Guideline 6 
Title ETC Dedicated Lane Island Widths 
Text In the absence of any other site conditions or safety requirements, 
dedicated lane islands should replicate the dimensions of other 
conventional plaza islands, in accordance with any agency or adopted 
design standards. 
Commentary For new or reconstructed facilities,  island width should be dictated by 
the more controlling toll booth width plus lane clearance or lane 
clearance plus safe access to toll island equipment. 
Guideline ETC Dedicated Lane Guideline 7 
Title ETC Dedicated Lane Posted Speeds 
Text 
  
  
Given compliance with other dedicated lane guidelines, a maximum-
posted speed of 25 - 30 mph (40 – 48 kph) is recommended.  In locations 
with many curves, merges and diverges within several hundred feet (i.e., 
one hundred meters) of the plaza, lower maximum-posted speeds are 
recommended. 
Commentary Maximum-posted speeds lower than 25 mph may apply for ramp plazas 
located within trumpet interchanges. 
  
Guideline ETC Dedicated Lane Guideline 8 
Title ETC Dedicated Lane Speed Differential Mitigation 
Text 
  
  
Barrier or pavement markings are recommended to separate dedicated lanes from 
cash lanes for a length of approximately one half of the queue zone.

6.2.3 Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) Express Lanes  
Guideline ETC Express Lane Guideline 1 
Title ETC Express Lane Count 
Text New express lane plaza design and construction should include the number of 
express lanes equal to the number of approach roadway lanes, including 
provisions for widening if the approach roadway is configured for future 
widening. 
Commentary This provision assures that a given toll plaza will never require future 
modifications or lane conversions to meet customer demand for non-
stop lanes.  This design guideline is important for several reasons: 
1) The appearance of a wide-open path “through the plaza” is a very 
effective marketing tool 
2) Once constructed, future changes are not required to 
accommodate higher ETC demand at the toll facilities, 
assuming the mainline is not widened.  This eliminates 
additional express lane design and construction along with the 
risk of reduced revenue resulting from delays caused by 
reconstruction. 
This guideline applies to full express lane plazas in new construction or 
re-construction. 
Guideline ETC Express Lane Guideline 2 
Title ETC Express Lane Orientation 
Text Express lanes should be oriented to the left, as a continuation of the 
mainline approach pavement. 
Commentary Express Lanes should appear to the driver as a simple continuation of the 
mainline through the tolling zone or point, not requiring any change in 
driving pattern. 
Guideline ETC Express Lane Guideline 3 
Title ETC Express Lane Separation of Traffic 
Text Express lanes should be protected and separated from conventional plaza 
traffic according to the expressway design criteria applied on the approach 
and departure roadways. 
Commentary Express Lanes should appear to the driver as a simple continuation of the 
mainline lanes, not requiring any change in driving pattern.

Title ETC Express Lane Utilization Restrictions 
Text Express lanes should not restrict usage by particular vehicle types, such as 
“cars only,” or “trucks only,” beyond those restrictions in force on the 
approach and departure roadway or the roadway facility in general. 
Commentary Express Lanes should appear to the driver as a simple continuation of the 
toll facility, not requiring any change in driving pattern. 
An exception is a single lane express lane, which should prohibit truck 
usage because the operational performance of trucks tends to cause delays 
and safety concerns when mixed in the same lane with passenger cars 
Guideline ETC Express Lane Guideline 5 
Title ETC Express Lane Roadway Geometry 
Text Express lanes should be designed meeting the same geometric 
requirements for grades, cross-slopes, clearances and clear zones, 
stopping sight distance and horizontal and vertical curvature, as is applied 
to the proximate approach and departure roadways. 
Commentary Express Lanes should appear to the driver as a simple continuation of the 
toll facility, not requiring any change in driving pattern. 
Guideline ETC Express Lane Guideline 6 
Title ETC Express Lane Posted Speeds 
Text Express lane posted speed should not deviate from the posted speed on 
the interconnecting mainline. 
Commentary Express Lanes should appear to the driver as a simple continuation of the 
mainline, not requiring any change in driving pattern.

Guideline Lane Assignment Guideline 1 
Title Lane Clustering 
Text All payment type lanes should be grouped together or clustered, 
particularly during peak traffic periods in the case of multi-mode 
capability.  This enables advance plaza configuration  signing to enable 
early decision-making on lane selection. 
Commentary This provision is intended to enable driver decision making to be done 
in stages, first to select the payment type, then selecting a particular lane 
offering the selected payment type based on queue length and its vehicle 
composition. 
Guideline Lane Assignment Guideline 2 
Title Permit or Over-Size Vehicles 
Text The far right lane should be sized to accept permit or oversized vehicles. 
Commentary This is consistent with common practice, and allows the slowest vehicles 
to stay to the right.  Note that if ETC dedicated lanes are oriented to the 
right of the plaza, this requires permit-vehicles to pay with ETC. 
Provisions for oversized vehicles may not be possible at constrained 
plazas and the underlying facility (e.g., size, structural capacity and safety 
considerations), particularly for bridges and tunnels. 
Guideline Lane Assignment Guideline 3 
Title Attended Lanes  
Text Attended lanes are slower processing lanes because of truck transactions, 
receipt processing and informational assistance, and should be located to 
the right side of the conventional plaza. 
Commentary Ramp plaza lanes may need attended lanes on both the left and right sides 
to more safely accommodate traffic arriving from and or departing to 
multiple directions.

Guideline Lane Assignment Guideline 5 
Title ETC Dedicated Lanes or ETC Express Lanes 
Text ETC dedicated lanes should be grouped or clustered and located to the 
left of the conventional plaza. Consideration should be given to locating 
dedicated lanes in the center of a ramp plaza if the plaza approach or 
departure receives or feeds, respectively, multiple directions of travel. 
Express lanes, by definition, must abut, be physically separated from the 
conventional plaza, and consist of at least two lanes. 
Commentary The intent is to breed familiarity by users when traveling multiple 
facilities. 
Guideline Toll Plaza Branch and Satellite Plazas Guideline 1 
Title Use of Branch and Satellite Plazas 
Text New toll plaza design should not include branch lanes and satellite plazas. 
Existing plazas containing these lanes should develop a plan for removal 
of these lanes by transitioning to ETC dedicated lanes that eventually 
provide throughput capacity equivalent to the satellite plaza capacity. 
Commentary As ETC participation grows after implementation, the overall plaza 
capacity increases and eliminates the need for branch and satellite plaza 
lanes.

Title Use of Reversible Toll Lanes on Standard Expressway Cross-Sections 
Text Reversible toll lanes should be avoided where possible and excluded 
from the design of new toll facilities. 
Commentary For existing barrier system plazas, it is recommended that the use of 
reversible lanes be discontinued as soon as possible for operations and 
safety reasons, as soon as ETC participation rates allow. 
At existing ticket-system plazas, it may be practically impossible to 
eliminate the use of reversible lanes, as overall operations are slow in 
these plazas, and additional capacity is often needed regardless of ETC 
participation. 
6.2.7 Administration Building Configuration and Access 
Guideline Administration Building Configuration and Access Guideline 1 
Title Accessway 
Text Toll plaza administration building accessway  should be located 
downstream from the toll collection point, on the side where the 
administration building is planned, which is normally the right side. 
Commentary An exception would be at ramp plazas or one-way roadways where the 
slower, cash toll lanes are located to the left.  In these cases, the building 
accessway should be located on the left. 
Design should be prepared following AASHTO design guidelines 
applicable in the departure area, where speeds are still slow. 
Guideline Administration Building Configuration and Access Guideline 2 
Title Personnel Lane Access 
Text For all new plaza construction with ETC dedicated lanes or express 
lanes and one administration building, provide a tunnel or overhead 
walkway. 
Commentary Toll island access to the tunnel or overhead walkway should be spaced 
so that toll collectors should not have to cross more than one live toll 
lane (i.e., access on every third toll island).

6.3 SIGNING, MARKINGS AND CHANNELIZATION 
 
This section presents a summary of all the proposed Guidelines from Chapter 3.  Each is 
listed in the following subsections in the order presented in the report as follows: 
 
· Advance Toll Plaza Signing 
· Canopy Signing 
· Toll Lane Signing 
· Speed Control/Mitigation 
· Lane-use Control Signals 
· Changeable Message Signs 
· Pavement Markings/Channelization/Impact Attenuators 
· Delineation 
· Flashing Beacons/Warning Lights 
 
 
6.3.1 Advance Toll Plaza Signing 
Guideline Advance Toll Plaza Signing Guideline 1 
Title Sign Spacing and Location – Express lanes 
Text Provide advance signs at approximately 1 and ½ miles in advance of the 
divergence of mainline express lanes (or some subset of the mainline 
lanes) from the conventional plaza lanes similar to interchange guide sign 
spacing.  Where the conventional plaza offers multiple payment types, an 
overhead sign should be installed approximately 800 feet from the 
canopy to provide guidance on the payment types available in the toll 
lanes ahead. 
Commentary It may not be possible to meet this guideline due to geometric 
constraints, but a minimum of two signs at 1 and ½ mile from the 
conventional plaza lane divergence should be provided.  After further 
analysis, an advance sign at approximately 2 miles from the stated 
reference point is considered optional, contrary to Table 3.4. The 
location of these signs should be determined based on field conditions 
to maximize their contribution to plaza operational performance and 
safety.

Title Sign Spacing and Location – Express lanes 
Text Provide a bridge structure with a sign array at the divergence of 
conventional plaza from the express lanes that continue on the roadway 
mainline alignment to display allowed payment types, vehicle restrictions 
and lane-use guidance. 
Commentary None 
Guideline Advance Toll Plaza Signing Guideline 3 
Title Lettering and letter-spacing 
Text Standard letter heights and letter-spacing in the FHWA’s MUTCD and 
Standard Highway Signs Book should be used in designing toll plaza sign 
messages at a minimum, with increased letter height desired to increase 
sign legibility in the vicinity of toll plazas. 
Commentary Complex driver maneuvers in the vicinity of toll plazas require increased 
sign legibility to enhance sign comprehension. 
6.3.2 Canopy Signing 
Guideline Canopy Signing Design Guideline 1 
Title Canopy Signs 
Text Plazas offering lanes with multiple payment types and services should 
include canopy signing centered above each lane to indicate the payment 
type and service supported. Lanes supporting the same payment type(s) 
should be grouped together and use the same background color for the 
fixed, static sign panel. Lane use signals should be installed above each 
conventional plaza lane to display the operating status (i.e., open or 
closed) of each toll lane that is visible from the start of the queue zone, 
as a minimum. 
Commentary Information to be provided on canopy signing may include payment 
types accepted (i.e., ETC, exact change/tokens, or change & receipts), 
and vehicle restrictions (e.g., cars only, trucks only, cars and trucks).  
A CMS is required to provide the flexibility of changing the payment 
type(s) supported by the lane and the lane status, thereby eliminating the 
need for a separate lane use signal.

6.3.3 Toll Lane Signing  
Guideline Toll Lane Signing Guideline 1 
Title Stop Signs 
Text Stop signs should be deployed in cash toll lanes to require all users to 
stop to either pay a toll or take a ticket.  A standard stop sign above a 
plaque containing supplemental information (e.g., pay toll, take ticket) or 
a modified stop sign stating “Stop Pay Toll” should be installed in the 
manual and ACM lanes and “Stop Take Ticket” should be installed in 
the ATIM lanes. 
Commentary  A compliant ETC user in a multi-payment type lane is not expected to 
be inconvenienced by stopping in the cash lanes, even though the island 
traffic signal may display a green state when observed by the user. 
Guideline Toll Lane Signing Guideline 2 
Title Speed Limit Signs 
Text Speed limit signs should be installed at the approach end to the toll 
island for all ETC dedicated lanes. 
Commentary Although deployment of speed limit signs in conjunction with stop 
signs should be avoided, where speed display signs are deployed in 
particular cash lanes because of excessive toll lane entry speeds, a speed 
limit sign should be installed in conjunction with the speed display sign. 
Guideline Toll Lane Signing Guideline 3 
Title Miscellaneous Signs 
Text Deployment of miscellaneous signs should be based on an assessment of 
the particular problem the sign is intended to address or the value of the 
benefit derived by the user from the information the sign provides. 
Commentary None. 
Guideline Toll Lane Signing Guideline 4 
Title Sign Horizontal Clearance 
Text A horizontal clearance of 12 inches should be used from the face of the 
toll island or raised barrier to the nearest edge of the sign or display. 
Commentary None.

6.3.4 Speed Control/Mitigation 
Guideline Speed Control/Mitigation Guideline 1 
Title Approach Speed Reduction 
Text Speed bumps, turtles or other raised in-pavement materials should not be 
used to reduce vehicle speed before entering a conventional plaza toll 
lane. 
Commentary This recommendation is not intended to preclude or discourage the use 
of rumble strips (slotted or raised thermoplastic) used to warn drivers 
veering out of a travel lane. 
Guideline Speed Control/Mitigation Guideline 2 
Title Departure Speed Control 
Text Signs should be placed to require trucks using cash lanes located to the 
right of the conventional plaza to use the right lane/ stay to the right 
when departing the plaza. 
Commentary This strategy may not be feasible when the length of the approach zone 
and queue zone is inadequate for trucks to safely merge to the right.  
Furthermore, manual lanes may not be located to the far right of the 
plaza, which primarily applies to ramp toll plazas being fed traffic from 
two directions 
6.3.5 Lane-use Control Signals  
Guideline Lane-use Control Signals Design Guideline 1 
Title Signal Design 
Text Recommend use of MUTCD standard green arrow and red “X” design 
for lane-use signals in lieu of traditional signal heads. 
Commentary Use of traditional signal head may cause confusion, as the green and red 
signal head indications generally mean “go” and “stop”, not “open” and 
“closed”.  Color blindness of an expected small percentage of the users 
justifies the display from a safety perspective.

provide readily accessible power and communication interconnections, 
be comprised of long life, high intensity LEDs, and be installed with a 
minimum vertical clearance of 17’. 
Commentary These requirements are considered general and are not intended for 
procurement purposes. 
6.3.6 Changeable Message Signs 
Guideline CMS Guideline 1 
Title CMS Technology 
Text CMS using a LED technology should be used for all new installations. 
Commentary When budget is a significant consideration and if visibility concerns can 
be adequately addressed for a particular installation, a CMS using a 
mechanical technology should be considered to satisfy a message 
variability requirement. 
Guideline CMS Guideline 2 
Title CMS Visibility 
Text The CMS should be visible for a distance at least equal to the depth of 
the queue zone plus an additional 40 - 50% approach factor. The 
minimum letter height should be 10.6 inches. Word messages for a 
conventional plaza canopy CMS should be created using all Upper Case 
letters. 
Commentary None. 
Guideline CMS Guideline 3 
Title CMS Brightness 
Text CMS using a light based technology should be capable of a minimum of 
three levels of brightness that are based on data inputs from a minimum 
of three photocells. 
Commentary Fog conditions may severely impact visibility regardless of the 
brightness level.

6.3.7 Pavement Markings/Channelization/Impact Attenuator 
Guideline Pavement Marking/Channelization/Impact Attenuator Guideline 1 
Title Toll Island/Attenuator Pavement Markings 
Text Gore or chevron pavement markings should be installed immediately in 
front of the impact attenuator, as applicable, or the toll island. 
Commentary While winter visibility and maintenance expenses are important 
considerations, the safety and operational benefits of reducing space for 
unsafe lane changes and maneuvering within the plaza and highlighting 
the areas of the plaza queue zone that do not lead to a toll lane justify the 
recommended pavement markings 
Guideline Pavement Marking/Channelization/Impact Attenuator Guideline 
2 
Title Lane Separation using Pavement Marking 
Text Extension of physical separation of ETC dedicated lanes and cash lanes 
should be accomplished using double 8 inch wide pavement markings. 
Commentary Except for standard edge markings, use of pavement markings within 
the queue and recovery zones should be evaluated based on such factors 
as traffic patterns, weather conditions, delays caused by maintenance, 
and improvements to operational performance. 
Guideline Pavement Marking/Channelization/Impact Attenuator Guideline 3 
Title Dedicated Lane Channelization 
Text Dedicated lanes within a conventional plaza should use both barrier and 
pavement markings that extend upstream to approximately the point 
where approaching vehicle speed to the cash lanes drops below 30 mph 
during off peak hours. 
Commentary The 30 mph threshold is deemed to be a reasonable maximum speed 
through an ETC dedicated lane. Channelization is intended to prevent or 
discourage vehicles from attempting to enter a dedicated lane by unsafely 
crossing the cash lanes when the driver inadvertently failed to get into the 
proper lane  when approaching the plaza.

Guideline Pavement Marking/Channelization/Impact Attenuator Guideline 4 
Title Toll Island/Impact Attenuator 
Text Impact attenuators/crash cushions should be installed at the approach 
end of all mainline plaza toll islands whenever the approach speed of 
vehicles can exceed 25 mph. 
Commentary For agencies to assure approach speeds do not exceed 25 mph, 
continuous rigorous enforcement using both enforcement personnel and 
speed detection devices in conjunction with a license plate capture system 
to issue high fines should be deployed.  Exhibit 3-8 shows the condition 
of a 1999 Volkswagen Passat after a front end collision with a stationary 
object when traveling at 35 miles per hour.  The damage shown should 
not be considered indicative of the damage sustained by other types of 
vehicles, which may be considerably more severe and therefore supports 
use of a lower threshold speed for deploying an attenuator. 
Guideline Pavement Marking/Channelization/Impact Attenuator Guideline 5 
Title Toll Island/Impact Attenuator 
Text Impact Attenuator/crash cushions for cash lanes should be designed for 
selected percent above the posted approach zone speed limit, plus 5 mph. 
For existing plazas, this percentage should be determined from field 
studies. Each impact attenuator/crash cushion type has specific 
requirements relative to cross slopes, grades, curbs, etc.  Consequently, 
profile grades and cross slopes for new construction should be designed 
per the specification of the impact attenuator/crash cushion. 
Commentary Pavement markings offering warning to approaching motorists should be 
considered for placement immediately in front of the impact attenuator/
crash cushions, in the form of a gore taper with diagonal striping or 
tapered chevrons. 
 
6.3.8 Delineation 
Guideline Delineation Guideline 1 
Title Plaza Delineation 
Text Flexible delineators for lane separation should not be installed  within a 
conventional plaza unless a quantitative and qualitative benefit-cost 
analysis supports the use of these devices. 
Commentary High maintenance cost and a lack of true physical separation are 
expected to eventually lead to more durable and reliable alternatives for 
separating vehicles.   For reversible lanes, the expected high maintenance 
costs of pop-up delineators may be less than the equipment, labor and 
materials costs and the possible delay cost imposed when relocating the 
barrier that are associated with moveable barrier, the primary physical 
separation alternative.

6.3.9 Flashing Beacons/Warning Lights 
Guideline Flashing Beacons/Warning Lights Design Guideline 1 
Title Supplement to Lane-use Signals 
Text Flashing beacons should not be installed together with lane-use signals, 
as it provides contradictory information to drivers. 
Commentary Use with lane-use signals presents contradiction to MUTCD. 
Guideline Flashing Beacons/Warning Lights Design Guideline 2 
Title Supplemental to Canopy Signs 
Text Flashing beacons may be used as warning devices with canopy lane 
status signs for ETC dedicated lanes only, with the intended purpose of 
indicating the location of the dedicated ETC lane(s) when approaching 
the conventional plaza lanes. 
Commentary Installation of the flashing beacon at the bottom of the lane status sign 
has been shown to be effective in highlighting the location of the ETC 
dedicated lanes when maneuvering within the queue zone to find the toll 
lane with the shortest vehicle queue. 
Guideline Flashing Beacons/Warning Lights Design Guideline 3 
Title Overall use of Flashing Beacons 
Text Flashing beacons may be used in overhead mounts to supplement 
canopy lane status signs for ETC dedicated lanes, or on impact 
attenuators, backup blocks or toll island crash blocks/ramparts at toll 
plazas. 
Commentary Use should be limited as much as possible to minimize distractions to 
drivers.  Only the yellow color application should be considered.  An 
automatic dimming device may be used to reduce the brilliance during 
night operation.  The flashing beacons mounted on the island should be 
at an appropriate height above the ground for viewing.

6.4 GEOMETRIC AND SAFETY DESIGN 
 
This section presents a summary of all the proposed Guidelines from Chapter 4.  Each is 
listed in the following subsections in the order presented in the report as follows: 
 
· Approach Zone 
· Departure Zone 
· Express Lane 
· Lane and Shoulder Width 
· Toll Island  
· Cross Slope 
· Vertical Profile Grade 
· Lighting 
 
6.4.1 Approach Zone 
Guideline Approach Zones Design Guideline 1 
Title Queue Zone Lengths 
Text The length of queuing zone should be based on estimated or actual peak 
hour queue lengths, determined by an analysis, plus an added safety 
factor, with a minimum of 200 feet.  Design year traffic volumes should 
be used. 
Commentary For plaza reconstruction and expansion, design should make use of a 
simulation model to calibrate existing plaza operations and to estimate 
plaza queuing and toll lane usage, or use professionally acceptable 
manual calculation methods (note: vehicle mix, daily/weekend/holiday 
profiles, and unusual demand generators).  The analysis must account 
for increased usage of express lanes and ETC dedicated lanes, which is 
expected to reduce conventional plaza queuing in the future. 
Guideline Approach Zones Design Guideline 2 
Title Transition Zone Tapers 
Text Transition zone tapers approaching the conventional plaza should use 
the minimum taper rates presented in the McDonald 19991 and 
McDonald and Stammer 20012 reports.  The diverge tapers from the 
latter publication for speeds of  40 mph or less is specified as 
L=WS/105 and for speeds 45 mph or more and L=3/8 WS for speeds 
45 mph or more, where L= minimum length (ft.), S= posted approach 
speed in mph, and W= offset distance in feet.  Use of a smaller taper for 
wide plazas and a minimum taper of 10:1 for speeds less than 30 mph

Title Proximity to On-ramp 
Text If the distance to safely change lanes to access the express lanes after 
entering the mainline from an upstream interchange on-ramp is not 
sufficient, this movement should be physically prevented through the 
use of barrier or delineator separated auxiliary lane extensions. 
Commentary Existence of an ETC dedicated lane or provisions to add one within the 
conventional plaza should minimize any inconvenience to the ETC 
customer. 
Guideline Approach Zones Design Guideline 4 
Title Express Lanes 
Text The approach transition zone begins at the start of the gore where the 
conventional plaza and express lanes split. 
Commentary For tunnel and bridge plaza approach zones, sensors and physical 
constraints should be deployed to prevent oversized trucks from 
entering a toll lane.  Provisions for safely maneuvering the vehicle out of 
the plaza area are required. 
6.4.2 Departure Zone 
Guideline Departure Zones Design Guideline 1 
Title Recovery Zone Lengths 
Text The departure recovery zone should be equal to at least 200 feet and 
preferably 300 feet, a length expected to allow sufficient driver re-
orientation, acceleration, and initial merge distance after exiting the plaza. 
Commentary For tunnel and bridge toll plazas, a longer recovery zone may be 
warranted for oversized vehicles to safely maneuver out of the plaza area 
if sensors and physical constraints are not available or deployed to detect 
an oversized vehicle prior to entering a toll lane, thereby precluding any 
maneuver to exit the plaza on or before the plaza approach.

Title Transition Zone Tapers 
Text Transition zone tapers departing the toll plaza should use the minimum 
taper rates presented in the McDonald 19991 and McDonald and 
Stammer 20012 reports.  The departure tapers presented in the latter 
publication for speeds of 40 mph or less is specified as L= (1.5)WS/105 
+ 5W where L= 3/8 WS for speeds 45 mph or more, where L= 
minimum length (ft), S= posted approach speed in mph and W= offset 
distance in feet.  Use of a smaller taper for wide plazas and a minimum 
taper of 10:1 for speeds less than 30mph was recommended. 
Commentary Reference the ITE Freeway and Interchange Geometric Design 
Handbook – Chapter 13 for further design information on taper rates. 
Guideline Departure Zones Design Guideline 3 
Title Proximity to Off-ramp 
Text If the distance to safely change lanes to reach the exit lane of a nearby 
downstream interchange from an express lane is not sufficient, this 
movement should be physically prevented by a downstream extension of 
the raised median or barrier separating express lanes and merging 
conventional plaza lanes. 
Commentary New construction should avoid potential information overload related to 
informing ETC users to exit the facility through the conventional plaza 
lanes in lieu of the express lanes by locating the plaza a sufficient distance 
from entry and exit ramps. For existing facilities, advance signing should 
be used to direct traffic that will be exiting at an interchange ramp just 
downstream of the plaza to use the conventional toll plaza lanes in lieu of 
the express lanes.  Existence of an ETC dedicated lane or provisions to 
add one within the conventional plaza should minimize any 
inconvenience to ETC customers. The number of ETC dedicated lanes 
required should  be calculated by estimating the percentage of ETC users 
exiting at a nearby downstream interchange ramp after traveling through 
a conventional plaza and or the percentage of ETC users entering the 
conventional plaza from a nearby upstream interchange on ramp. These 
percentages are then converted to volumes of dedicated lane ETC traffic 
and combined with an estimated residual of ETC traffic that elects to use 
the dedicated lane in lieu of the express lanes or all ETC mainline traffic 
if there are no express lanes.

Title Express Lane Departure 
Text The departure recovery and transition zones should be fully completed 
prior to the merge with continuing express lanes. (i.e. merged lanes 
should equal the number of lanes on the typical roadway section 
downstream of the plaza area), subject to provisions for merging with 
any express lanes. 
Commentary An auxiliary lane may be used to temporarily increase the number of 
lanes merging with the continuing roadway lanes after exiting the 
conventional plaza. 
Guideline Dedicated Lane Design Guideline 5 
Title Recovery Zone Dedicated Lane Design 
Text Placement of physical separation devices for dedicated lane traffic should 
be extended beyond the toll islands until traffic in the adjacent lanes that 
had stopped to pay the toll has accelerated to 50% of the operating 
speed.  As a minimum, solid white striping should continue until the 
accelerating traffic has reached a point of approximately two-thirds 
(66%) of the operating speed based on the average acceleration rate of a 
mid-size vehicle. 
Commentary Although specific locations are provided, the intent is to minimize the 
potential hazards of differential speeds when exiting a toll plaza. 
6.4.3 Express Lanes 
Guideline Express Lane Design Guideline 1 
Title Lane Placement 
Text To avoid or minimize potential conflicts, express lanes should be located 
to the far left of the plaza. 
Commentary This is consistent with general highway travel, therefore, meets the 
expectations of the drivers.  This effectively prohibits any reversible lane 
operation.  Facilities where staff must access tollbooths or toll equipment 
from a facility located in the median, a tunnel or overhead walkway is 
needed to accommodate express lanes located to the far left.  See 
Chapter 2 for more information on toll plaza configuration.

Guideline Express Lane Design Guideline 2 
Title Express Lane Design 
Text Design of express lanes should preferably be a continuation of the 
normal mainline lanes with similar features (i.e. design speed, lane widths, 
and shoulder widths).  The split between the express lanes and the 
conventional plaza lanes should occur prior to approach transition zone 
for the adjacent conventional plaza, and the merge downstream of the 
toll plaza should occur after the departure transition zone. (see Figure-3 
and subsections 4.1 and 4.2). 
Commentary A barrier wall, guardrail, delineators and/or other types of physical 
separation should be considered between the express lanes and the 
conventional toll plaza lanes when highway standard clear zone 
separation is available to prevent confused and deviant drivers from 
trying to access the conventional plaza. 
Guideline Express Lane Design Guideline 3 
Title Diverging and Merging Express Lane and Conventional Plaza Lane 
Traffic 
Text Design of the conventional plaza approach and departure zones from 
and to the roadway mainline should comply with pertinent elements of 
interchange design, whereby the express lanes function the same as the 
mainline through lanes. 
Commentary The design must account for the available right-of-way and the ultimate 
number of express and conventional plaza lanes, shoulder widths, and 
median.  The ultimate express lane width should be equal to the ultimate 
mainline cross section. 
 
6.4.4 Lane and Shoulder Width 
Guideline Lane and Shoulder Width Design Guideline 1 
Title Manual and ACM/ATIM Lanes 
Text Toll lane width should be a minimum of 11 feet, with 12 feet desirable 
to accommodate large vehicles. 
Commentary A far right manual lane width of at least 16 feet should be considered for 
over-sized vehicles.  For existing facilities, this same objective may be 
achieved by a 12 foot lane and a 4 foot shoulder.

accommodate larger vehicles, if permitted. 
Commentary None 
Guideline Lane and Shoulder Width Design Guideline 3 
Title Express ETC Lanes 
Text Toll lane and shoulder widths should match the typical section design 
used for the approaching roadway. 
Commentary Some shoulder restriction may be needed to the inside shoulder to 
accommodate a bridge or gantry structure foundation used to support 
overhead toll and violation enforcement equipment when the median 
width is insufficient. This isolated shoulder reduction should be tapered 
and be limited in length to minimize the impact on an emergency vehicle 
using the shoulder to bypass congested traffic conditions when the 
shoulder width is sufficient for vehicle travel. 
6.4.5 Toll Island  
Guideline Toll Island Guideline 1 
Title Toll Island Width 
Text The island width should be a minimum of six (6) feet, and provide at 
least a minimum of one (1) foot of clearance on each side of the 
tollbooth or combined booth and ACM/ATIM equipment. For 
standalone ACM/ATIM equipment lanes, the width should be based on 
safe clearance for servicing (e.g., changing coin vaults, stacking tickets, 
maintenance servicing) the equipment, subject to the recommended 
minimum. 
Commentary Design must consider an acceptable clearance offsets for ACM/ATIM 
equipment from the curb face for customer convenience during 
transactions.

Guideline Toll Island Guideline 2 
Title Toll Island Length 
Text The length of a toll island can vary based on the following: design of 
island access facilities (e.g., stairwell, stairway), space requirements for 
toll collection and traffic control equipment, and provisions for 
tollbooth and equipment protection.  Toll island length in a conventional 
plaza should be uniform even though the island supporting manual 
collection tends to be the longest and ETC dedicated lanes tend to be 
the shortest. Specifically, the length of a manual island depends on the 
design of the tollbooth; design of any stairway for an overhead walkway 
or stairwell for an access tunnel; provisions for violation enforcement 
and traffic control equipment; tollbooth protection; design of canopy 
supports; provisions for staff access across the islands; and aesthetic 
considerations. 
Commentary A possible exception to the manual lane being the control island length is 
when ACM/ATIM equipped lanes (i.e., automatic lanes) permit truck 
use and thereby deploy a pre-classification subsystem that requires a 
minimum 5-axle truck length in advance of the ACM/ATIM equipment 
so the correct toll or class can be displayed or printed to the ticket, 
respectively. 
Guideline Toll Island Guideline 3 
Title Rampart and Crash Blocks 
Text Tollbooth protection provided by ramparts and crash blocks should be 
designed to withstand anticipated loads of design vehicles. The rampart 
should be designed to redirect errant vehicles and not launch the vehicle.  
Crash blocks are constructed of reinforced concrete and can incorporate 
aesthetic features such as planters. 
Commentary Double crash blocks should be considered if large vehicles are permitted.  
Longer blocks may be considered in lieu of a rampart.  Design should be 
performed by an experienced structural engineer.  If planters are used, 
any planted vegetation should not block the collector’s vision of 
approaching vehicles and a filtered drainage outlet is required.

Title Staff Access 
Text Grade separated access to toll islands should be considered so no more 
than a single lane must be crossed to gain access to the intended island.  
Design should include a means to block access into the adjacent lane by 
installing a pedestrian gate, moveable barrier, or a chain or rope strung 
between two posts at the edges of the toll island to warn and protect 
staff crossing lanes. 
Commentary Two alternatives for grade-separated crossing access are an access 
tunnel immediately below the tollbooth and an overhead walkway. In 
addition to stairway access to these facilities, for new construction ADA 
regulations may require the inclusion of elevator access subject to 
official job descriptions and minimum requirements to perform the 
work If using a pedestrian gate or moveable barrier, it should not 
extend into the adjacent toll lane when “open”. 
 
6.4.6 Cross Slopes 
Guideline Cross Slope Design Guideline 1 
Title Cross Slope Ranges 
Text Design of cross slopes should follow the methods and guidelines 
provided by the AASHTO “Green Book” and or the respective state 
DOT design manuals.  Drainage design needs to address runoff from the 
canopy. Cross slopes will typically range from 1%-2% on tangent 
roadway sections and higher on curves. 
Commentary The drainage design must combine cross slopes with longitudinal grade 
to avoid any water ponding within the toll plaza.  Canopy runoff should 
be directly piped into the drainage system. 
Guideline Cross Slope Design Guideline 2 
Title Rollover Ranges 
Text Design of rollover of adjacent lanes should follow the methods and 
guidelines provided by the AASHTO “Green Book” and or the 
respective state DOT design manuals.  Rollover should be limited to a 
combine grade differential of 4%.

6.4.7 Vertical Profile Grade  
Guideline Vertical Profile Grade Guideline 1 
Title Plaza Approach and Departure Profile Grades 
Text In cases of mixed flow traffic, the vertical profile grade approaching and 
departing the toll plaza should be greater than or equal to + 1% and less 
than or equal to +2%. 
Commentary The upper limit on vertical profile grades may be increased to +3 when 
the percentage of commercial vehicles is low and the toll plaza is located 
at the crest of the profile grade. 
Guideline Vertical Profile Grade Guideline 2 
Title Toll Lane Profile Grades 
Text The vertical profile grade in a toll lane should be equal to or greater than 
+ 0.5% and less than or equal to +2%. 
Commentary The cross slope and profile grade should be designed in conjunction to 
avoid storm drainage flows across the entrance to the toll lane. The 
canopy and storm drainage system design should direct collected water 
away from the toll lanes and help reduce precipitation within the toll 
lane. 
 
6.4.8 Lighting 
Guideline Lighting Design Guideline 1 
Title Intensity and Uniform Coverage 
Text Intensity levels and uniformity ratios should be based on adaptations 
from the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and 
Illuminating Engineering Society (IES). 
Commentary ITE recommends an average illuminance of 1.0-4.0 foot-candles for 
pedestrian facilities, which is deemed insufficient for supporting a CCTV 
security system and providing a high level of visibility to agency staff.

environmental document(s). 
Guideline Lighting Design Guideline 3 
Title Quantity of Plaza Approach and Departure Lights 
Text High mast and tower pole designs for mounting luminaries should be 
used to minimize the addition of roadway hazards that must be 
protected by barrier if inadequate clear zone is available or is impractical. 
Commentary Tower design, and to a lesser extent high mast design (based of an 
internal luminaries lowering mechanism) must address the issue of 
accessing the luminaries for maintenance. 
Guideline Lighting Design Guideline 4 
Title Toll Lane Lighting 
Text Lighting intensity and uniformity should be based on adaptations from 
the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and Illuminating 
Engineering Society (IES). 
Commentary Toll lane lighting should provide a minimum of 20 foot-candles for at 
least 25 feet each side of the tollbooth or automatic machine (i.e., coin, 
payment or ticket issuing) centerline, subject to consideration of 
contributions from other site-specific light sources. This level of lighting 
is intended to enhance plaza security including camera video and 
improve visibility of agency staff crossing a toll lane.

the user has immediate feedback when an invalid coin or token is 
deposited. 
Guideline Toll Collection Equipment Technology Guideline 5 
Title Provisions for Accommodating Trucks in an ACM Lane 
Text Dual height ACMs should not be implemented in automatic lanes unless 
daily truck volume through the lane exceeds 25% and this solution is 
determined to be more economical than a preclass or VES based solution. 
Commentary This recommendation factors in the continued growth in ETC 
penetration and expansion of payment machines using bill changers and 
credit card proximity readers capable of handling any toll amount, 
affectively limiting ACMs to unattended ramp plazas.

Guideline Island Traffic Signal  Guideline 2 
Title ITS Location 
Text The ITS should be installed approximately 15 feet beyond the 
downstream edge of the presence or arming loop. 
Commentary This location assumes 15 feet represents the detection length of a typical 
vehicle, the installation of a presence loop at the collection point, and 
there are no physical constraints to this location. Otherwise, alternative 
locations should be considered and field tested.

Title Provisions for Automatic Lane Barrier Gates in Toll Plaza Deploying 
VES Equipment 
Text VES equipment should be used in lieu of automatic barrier gates unless 
vehicle speeds through the automatic lane pose a safety hazard to 
attendants who must cross more than one lane. 
Commentary  To avoid the revenue loss from opening the gate for customers who fail 
to fully pay the displayed toll, plus the operational costs incurred to 
assure the gate arm raises and to maintain the gates, VES equipment 
should be deployed instead of automatic barrier gates. The automatic 
barrier gate installed at the departure end of the toll island to control the 
flow of traffic  through a lane should not be confused with a pedestrian 
gate installed on the toll island to prevent staff or visitors from walking 
into a toll lane.   This particular gate is rarely automated. 
Guideline Automatic Lane Barrier Gate Guideline 2  
Title Provisions for Automatic Lane Barrier Gates in Toll Plazas with no VES 
Equipment Deployment 
Text Barrier gates should only be deployed in these lanes if both the 
supervisor’s workstation functionality and an adjacent manual/attended 
lane toll terminal functionality are capable of remotely raising the gate in 
the automatic lane. 
Commentary None. 
Guideline Automatic Lane Barrier Gate Guideline 3

1) allows the attendant to service all vehicle types while providing 
protection against slipping or falling into the toll lane; and 2) provides a 
means for the attendant to quickly enter the lane and then return to the 
booth, when traffic conditions permit. 
Commentary None 
Guideline Tollbooth Design Guideline 4 
Title Tollbooth Protection 
Text For new construction, the tollbooth should be protected by concrete 
ramparts and/or mass concrete formations, such crash blocks and 
planters. 
Commentary Bollards pose problems with plaza aesthetics, attendant visibility and 
customer’s additional repellence from the tollbooth due to a perceived 
hazard, thereby making the exchange of money and receipts more 
difficult. 
Guideline Toll Collection Equipment Technology Guideline 29 
Title Tollbooth Accessibility after Failed ETC Transaction 
Text To eliminate the incident of vehicles backing up in the lane to pay the 
attendant after a failed ETC transactions, the following alternatives 
should be evaluated: 1) move the antenna location further upstream if the 
plaza canopy and software can support this location; 2) add VES 
equipment (i.e., front and rear cameras if necessary) to capture a license 
plate images and modify the software to provide a green light if a 
transponder Agency Code is read. 
Commentary Failure to read an agency code may be the result of a failed battery or 
other transponder malfunction or the Agency code is unrecognizable to 
the ETC reader.

Traffic Control Devices at Transponder-controlled Toll Booth Lanes -  Final Report 
prepared by Gary A. Golembiewski and Richard L. Knoblauch Center with Applied 
Research, Inc. with contributions from the Pooled Fund Consortium.  
 
December 
29, 2004 
This study reviewed selected ETC toll road signs in the United States to help determine four basic 
elements (background color, font color, underlay color, and pictograph) and options to be used in a 
laboratory experiment. Analysis of the results showed the following: 
· Overall, green as a background color obtained the longest guidance information legibility 
distance, 
· Fonts that provided the highest contrast to the background color (such as white) were most 
effective for legibility, 
· The EZ TAG pictograph (which was purple, as were all pictographs in this study) showed 
dramatically longer legibility distances than did the other pictographs, this result was 
consistent across all underlay colors, 
· The underlay colors that showed the highest contrast to the pictographs were most effective 
and included all the lighter colors 
 tested (white, yellow, and light blue)

GLOSSARY OF TERMS AND DIAGRAMS 
 
 
 
GLOSSARY  
 
This Glossary of terms and associated diagrams is intended to provide a common 
definition and form a mutual understanding for all users of this report:  
 
AASHTO – American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials. 
 
ACM – Automatic Coin Machine – Unattended toll collection equipment installed on a 
toll island consisting of a coin hopper to collect and funnel coins or tokens, a coin 
processor for identifying and recording coin denominations, and automatic locking coin 
vaults for storing coins or tokens.  
 
ADA – Americans with Disabilities Act. 
 
Approach Queue Zone – A rectangular shaped area extending longitudinally from the far 
approach edge of the toll islands to a distance in front of the toll plaza where one or both 
of the outside edges of the zone begin to taper toward the center of the plaza and 
transversely to encompass all toll plaza lanes (excluding express lanes). This area is 
intended to provide space for vehicle queues without blocking approaching vehicle access 
to any of the open toll lanes.   
 
Approach Transition Zone – The area upstream of the toll plaza where the roadway 
widens from the typical roadway section in advance of the toll plaza to the width of the 
approach queue zone. 
 
ATIM – An automatic ticket issuing machine or automatic ticket dispenser (ATD) that is 
used to dispatch a ticket coded with time, date, a default vehicle class and entry location 
information used to determine the toll due when exiting the facility.  A loop detector 
activation is commonly used to signal the ATIM or ATD to automatically issue a ticket.  
 
Barrier Gate – An automatic gate consisting of a breakaway gate arm, motor assembly and 
housing installed at the departure end of a toll island.  A barrier gate is used to reduce 
violations and speed through a toll lane.  Barrier gates installed in both attended and 
unattended lanes commonly includes a remote control capability to raise the gate for 
patrons with insufficient funds.  
 
Beacon - A traffic signal, commonly consisting of one signal head that operates in a 
flashing mode.  It is used to draw attention to a sign, obstruction, or hazardous condition.

Branch Toll Lanes – Channelized toll lanes located either in advance of or after a toll 
plaza that are used to increase toll plaza capacity within existing right-of-way constraints. A 
single main toll plaza lane is effectively converted to multiple lanes using the same modes 
of collection available in the main toll plaza by shifting the collection points either 
upstream or downstream. 
 
Bypass Lanes – A lane that circumvents the toll plaza that is typically used by special 
permit and oversized vehicles. When this lane is routed around the administration building, 
it is also used for deliveries to the toll plaza and building. The lane may also be used for an 
oversized vehicle to turnaround. Gates, cameras and other security control features are 
commonly used to restrict access to these lanes.  
 
Canopy – A structure consisting of a roof and support columns used to protect toll 
attendants and customers from precipitation.  This structure is commonly used to support 
overhead signs and signals along with ETC and violation enforcement equipment.   
 
Cars-only ETC Lane - A dedicated ETC lane allowing only cars equipped with a valid 
transponder to use the lane to record a toll transaction. 
 
CMS - Changeable Message Sign – A traffic control device capable of changing state by 
displaying one or more messages. These signs support a blank mode, multiple messages 
alternately displayed, and more than one message with one message continuously displayed. 
A CMS displays pertinent traffic operational, regulatory, warning, and guidance 
information. These signs are capable of being changed manually, by remote control, or by 
automatic controls. Toll plazas typically use a single or multi-line electronic sign mounted 
overhead to display the operating status and toll collection mode of a single or group of toll 
lanes located ahead or directly below the CMS.  LEDs and illuminated fiber strands are the 
most common technologies used to display messages.  The CMS can be mounted to a 
canopy, gantry, bridge, or cantilever structure and requires provisions for accessing the 
signs internal components from the front, rear or interior of the sign.  
 
Crash Block – Formed reinforced or mass concrete placed in front of a tollbooth to 
protect the tollbooth and attendant from direct vehicle collisions.  A crash block can be 
placed monolithic with a toll island or separately after placement of the toll island. The 
height of the crash block is limited by the tollbooth window height and the width is 
normally limited by the width of the toll island minus a setback to minimize damage to 
passing vehicles. Single crash blocks are commonly used in conjunction with ramparts and 
dual crash blocks are commonly used on longer length toll islands. 
 
Crash Cushion – See “Impact Attenuator”. 
 
Dedicated ETC Lane – A toll lane within a conventional toll plaza that is dedicated to an 
ETC method of payment, thereby limiting use of the lane to vehicles having a valid 
transponder. Except for maintenance servicing, this lane is typically open 24 hours per day. 
Three common variations of these lanes are mixed-use, cars-only, and trucks-only.  These 
lanes are normally located to the left of a directional toll plaza, but may be located in the 
center or on the right side because of vehicles entering the plaza from two directions, to

accommodate reversible lanes, reduce implementation cost by converting only ACM lanes 
and low expected usage. 
 
Delineator – A retro-reflective device mounted on the roadway surface or at the side of  
the roadway, typically in a series, to indicate alignment of  the roadway and to channelize 
vehicles to form queues and/or prevent crossing into an adjacent lane or accessway.  
 
Departure Recovery Zone – A rectangular shaped area extending longitudinally from the 
far departure edge of the toll plaza islands to a distance downstream of the toll plaza where 
one or both of the outside edges of the zone begin to taper toward the center of the plaza 
and transversely to encompass all toll plaza lanes (excluding express lanes).  This area 
allows motorists to orient themselves to the approaching tapers and the possible need to 
merge to the left or right after exiting the toll lane.  
 
Departure Transition Zone - The area immediately downstream of the departure 
recovery zone of the toll plaza where the width of the roadway narrows to the width of the 
typical roadway section.  
 
Diffusers – Slightly angled horizontal slats mounted in front of a high intensity light to 
diffuse a light beam used to enhance the capture of a vehicle license plate.  The slats are 
commonly welded to a four-sided box.  Diffusers are used to mitigate impairment of a 
driver’s visions when viewed directly or from a rear-view mirror.  
 
DOT – Department of Transportation 
 
ETC – Electronic Toll Collection – A subsystem capable of electronically charging a toll 
to an established customer account by reading a number matched to an account and 
encoded on a transponder that is mounted inside or to the bumper of a vehicle. Lane level 
equipment consists of an overhead mounted antenna, a transceiver/modulator for 
processing RF signals, a reader/controller for both verification processing and data storing, 
and a vehicle mounted transponder.  
 
Express Lanes – Roadway lanes effectively equivalent in design to the approach and 
departure roadway sections with the exception of roadside barrier installed to minimize the 
severity of collisions with a vertical support of a bridge, gantry or cantilever structure used 
to support toll collection, vehicle classification and violation enforcement equipment. Tolls 
are predominately charged using an electronic process for vehicles having a valid 
transponder and to a much lesser extent by capturing vehicle license plates and assessing a 
toll to the registered vehicle owner.  The primary method of violation enforcement in these 
lanes is license plate capture using overhead or side mounted cameras. All toll and violation 
transactions are recorded while vehicles are traveling through the lanes at prevailing 
highway speeds.

pertaining to design formulation. 
 
High Mast Lighting – Multiple luminaries typically installed in a ring configuration at the 
top of a pole at least 55 feet tall.  The interior of the pole commonly houses components of 
a lowering mechanism used to drop the ring of luminaries to an adjustable distance above 
ground level for maintenance.  
 
Impact Attenuator – An energy absorbing crash cushion designed to decrease the 
momentum of a vehicle traveling at a particular speed and reducing the severity of property 
damage and injuries to the driver of the vehicle and the toll attendant operating from inside 
a downstream toll booth. The back end of the impact attenuator is anchored a concrete 
back-up block for stability and to minimize the potential of the vehicle colliding with a toll 
booth or equipment. 
 
ITE – Institute of Transportation Engineers - An international association of 
transportation professionals responsible for planning, designing, implementing, operating, 
and maintaining the surface and ground transportation systems of the world.  ITE provides 
for the professional development of members and others in meeting society’s needs for 
safe, efficient and environmentally compatible transportation.  
 
ITS – Island Traffic Signal – Two or three vertically stacked standard traffic signal heads 
mounted to the top of a stanchion or post.  The ITS is mounted at the downstream end of 
the toll island. Red and green signal heads convey the same meaning as traffic signals 
installed at intersection, while a yellow signal head is commonly used to indicate a low ETC 
account balance. The ITS may also include a combination alarm and light mounted to the 
top of the assembly that is activated by the System whenever a vehicle exits the lane 
without recording a paid transaction.  
 
Lane Use Signal – A device commonly mounted over the center of a toll lane and used to 
display an open or closed lane operating status.  The most common signal types installed in 
toll plazas use a red “X” for closed and green “↓” for open. These symbols are primarily 
formed from LEDs or illuminated fiber strands, either installed in an off-the-shelf 
environmental enclosure or part of a multi-line changeable message sign. Horizontally 
placed red and green traffic signal heads are also used to display lane status.  
 
Light Curtain – An array of  photoelectric sensors that emit and receive sequenced and 
modulated light beams that are used to detect the presence and/or define a profile of  a 
vehicle. A controller is used to receive an output signal from each receiver, apply logic for 
reliable detection or profiling under varying environmental conditions, and communicate 
output and operational messages to an interconnected processor (e.g. lane controller).     
 
Manual Toll Collection -  A method of toll collection involving a toll attendant classifying 
vehicles, collecting cash or swiping magnetic cards, providing change and receipts, and 
collecting vehicle information for instances of unpaid tolls.   
 
Mixed-Use ETC Lane – A dedicated ETC lane allowing both cars and trucks equipped 
with a valid transponder to use the lane to record a toll transaction.

effectively creates a barrier to prevailing traffic flow, with the exception of express lanes, 
and to a lesser extent, dedicated lanes. 
 
Moveable Barrier – A series of linked concrete or sand-filled barriers used to separate 
opposing flows of traffic and capable of being moved by automated, continuous-flow, 
mechanical means to change traffic patterns. 
 
MUTCD – Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices 
 
Photoelectric Beam – An electrical device that is used to detect the presence of a vehicle 
at the location of the barrier gate arm. Toll facility implementations commonly consist of 
either emitter and receiver self-contained units or a self-contained emitter/receiver and 
reflector. The receiver sends an analog or digital output signal when changes in light 
intensity are detected.  
 
PTD – Patron Toll Display - A relatively small electronic sign installed downstream of a 
toll booth or ACM to display toll due and toll paid messages and amounts for a particular 
vehicle class.  A flip disc matrix consisting of movable discs coated with fluorescent dots is 
the most commonly used sign display technology. 
 
Queue – A stacking of vehicles waiting to be serviced and/or processed by a toll attendant, 
ACM/ATIM, or ETC equipment. 
 
Rampart – Sloped reinforced or mass concrete on the approach of the toll island intended 
to redirect an errant vehicle.  The sloped concrete rises toward the booth and often 
connects to a crash block.  The rampart may have rounded or approximately square edges.   
 
RF – Radio Frequency – An electromagnetic wave frequency intermediate between audio 
frequencies and infrared frequencies, used especially in radio and television transmission as 
well as for transmission of information between a vehicle-mounted transponder and an 
overhead antenna.  
 
Superelevation – An increase in the normal roadway cross slope or transitional removal of 
adverse crown or cross slope to flat before gradually increasing the roadway slope or tilting 
the roadway surface to partially counterbalance the centripetal force (i.e., lateral 
acceleration) on a vehicle that is negotiating a horizontal curve.  The process is reversed 
upon exiting the curve.  
 
Superelevation Rate – The rate of rise in cross section of the finished surface of a 
roadway on a curve, measured from the lowest or inside edge to the highest of outside 
edge.

APPENDIX B 
TRAFFIC CONTROL STRATEGIES 
 AT TOLL BOOTH PLAZAS  
EXPERT PANEL WORKSHOP SUMMARY 
AUGUST 17-18, 2004 
BACKGROUND 
Wilbur Smith Associates (WSA) organized an Expert Panel workshop on August 17th and 18th, 
2004 in Lisle, Illinois. The workshop is one element of the Federal Highway Administration 
(FHWA) sponsored study on “Traffic Control Strategies at Toll Booth Plazas”. The WSA 
Team for this project also includes Post, Buckley, Schuh & Jernigan (PBSJ) and Terry 
Geohegan, a subconsultant to WSA.  
The objectives of the study are to review current practices and develop guidelines for designing 
traffic control devices for toll plazas that inform drivers which lanes to use for specific methods 
of payment, to reduce speed variance, and minimize lane changing. The goal is to have a 
consistent strategy to accommodate the mix of non-stop traffic and stop-and-go traffic in 
retrofitted conventional toll facilities. This requires identifying and handling the potential points 
of conflict at toll plazas so that safety and operations are enhanced, better efficiency and 
economy of design are achieved, and motorist recognition and comprehension are improved. A 
major objective of the study is to create consensus agreement among the toll agencies to ensure 
use and ideally, adoption of the design guidelines developed by this project.  
Prior to the workshop, the WSA Team developed a detailed survey addressing design 
considerations for toll plazas, specifically focused on the placement, design and usage of traffic 
control devices. The survey also addressed geometric design and operational aspects of toll 
plazas as they relate to traffic control strategies employed by agencies. Express Electronic Toll 
Collection (ETC), Dedicated ETC, Automatic Coin Machine/Automatic Ticket Issuing Machine, 
and Manual Toll Collection toll lanes were addressed in detail by the survey. The survey was 
designed for completion on-line, hosted on the Wilbur Smith Associates corporate website, and 
toll agencies were notified of the survey in early May 2004. Toll agencies were provided 
instructions on how to complete the survey, as well as a detailed “Terms and Definitions” 
document.  
The WSA Team analyzed the survey and distributed the results to all participants and observers 
prior to the workshop. The survey results and summaries of selected design elements were 
provided at the workshop. These materials, together with a brief program, were used as the basis  
1 
for the Expert Panel workshop discussions. The WSA Team also prepared a presentation on toll 
plaza signing, hardware and equipment to illustrate the variety of usage and serve as a basis for 
initiating the discussion.  
The Expert Panel consisted of seven panel members, four team members, and observers from 
FHWA and the International Bridge, Tunnel and Turnpike Association (IBTTA). Panel members 
were selected to represent a wide range of experience and toll facilities. The size of the panel was 
intentionally limited to a small number to ensure in-depth discussion of the issues outlined in the 
program. The workshop was moderated by Glenn Havinoviski, the WSA Project Director. The 
participants in the workshop are listed below.  
Panel Participants: Team Participants: 
Terry Geohegan (Bader & Geohegan) Glenn Havinoviski (WSA) 
David McDonald (Hanson Prof. Svcs.) Raghu Kowshik (WSA) 
Greg LeFrois (HNTB) George Scheuring (WSA) 
Michael Davis (PBSJ and Florida Turnpike) Phil Miller (PBSJ) 
Sam Wolfe (Indiana Toll Road) Observers: 
Kerry Ferrier (Ohio Turnpike Commission) Linda Brown (FHWA) 
Roxane Mukai (Maryland Transportation Authority) Neil Gray (IBTTA) 
The workshop was divided into four sessions, each focused on a particular topic area. The 
following session topics were selected prior to the panel discussion based on anticipated impact 
on toll plaza operations and safety: 
Session A: Signing, Pavement Markings & Channelization 
Session B: Lane Configuration/Plaza Operations and Safety 
Session C: Geometric Design, Attenuators, Safety Barriers 
Session D: Manual, ACM/ATIM, ETC Equipment Implementation 
WORKSHOP SUMMARY 
Introduction and Study Objectives 
The workshop began with introduction of the participants, project team members and observers. 
Following the introductions, WSA’s Project Director, Glenn Havinoviski, described the overall 
objectives of the study. Linda Brown, FHWA’s Project Manager, then described the intended 
outcome of the study. Ms. Brown indicated that FHWA would like to develop a section of the 
Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) addressing traffic control devices for toll 
facilities by 2005-6. She indicated that the best practices and guidelines for toll plaza traffic 
control device design and implementation developed in this study would provide input into the 
new section of the MUTCD.  
Several panel members asked whether the intent of the study was to provide traffic control 
device guidelines for new toll facilities, or whether the guidelines would also apply to existing 
facilities. The WSA Team responded that while the design guidelines would be most easily  
2 
adopted when designing new facilities, they could also be adopted by toll agencies when 
retrofitting or rebuilding existing toll plazas. The WSA Team further explained that toll agencies 
would not be expected to immediately conform to the best practices and design guidelines 
produced by this study. Rather, the product of this study would serve as a guide for agencies to 
voluntarily adopt when they rebuild or retrofit existing facilities. In addition, WSA indicated that 
when a section is added to the MUTCD addressing toll facility traffic control devices, there 
would typically be a period within which agencies would be required to comply. It was generally 
agreed that the design guidelines produced by this study would focus on new installations, 
although agencies should strongly consider using the recommendations as guidelines when 
retrofitting existing facilities.  
The WSA Team then presented a compilation of photographs from various agencies to illustrate 
the variety of signing and other traffic control devices used at toll plazas.  
Session B: Plaza Operation and Lane Configuration 
It was suggested that the panel begin by discussing plaza lane configuration and layout (Session 
B) before discussing plaza signing, pavement markings and channelization (Session A). The 
WSA Team explained that plaza operation/lane configuration issues (such as whether similar 
payment types are grouped or vary based on traffic demand) often dictate the types and 
placement of traffic control devices. Grouping lanes by payment type, and the location of these 
lanes at the plaza (e.g. grouping non-stop ETC lanes on the left of the plaza) allows advance 
signing to orient drivers further away from the plaza. However, several agencies vary the number 
of lanes of a specific payment type, their location at the plaza, and vehicle types permitted to 
accommodate varying traffic demands. The types and location of traffic control devices to 
address these situations will differ from those used when lane configurations do not vary.  
The panel then took up the issue of grouping of lanes and the placement of non-stop ETC lanes 
at the plaza. Discussion first focused on Express ETC lane plazas. Some panelists asked what 
constitutes an Express lane plaza. The WSA Team responded that these lanes are typically 
nonstop ETC-only lanes that operate at highway speed, are separated from the conventional toll 
plaza lanes by a barrier (such as concrete wall or earth berm), and the plaza canopy does not 
usually extend over these lanes. The panel indicated that there is a need to standardize the 
terminology used to describe various plaza types. Discussion focused on the location of Express 
ETC lanes, with the consensus being that as a general guideline Express ETC lanes be placed on 
the left side of mainline plazas, when constructing new plazas. It was recognized that this 
recommendation might not apply to retrofitted plazas. Some panelists also indicated that the 
placement of Express lanes on the left permits the area separating the Express and conventional 
lanes to be used as a staging area for enforcement vehicles. One panelist indicated that trucks are 
not permitted in their Express lanes. This restriction exists due to the need to perform security 
checks on trucks prior to entering bridges and tunnels. Another panelist indicated that at ramp 
plazas, Express ETC lanes are provided on the right of exact-change coin machine lanes. This 
lane configuration protects toll plaza workers who have to service the coin machines, by keeping 
the workers away from the non-stop traffic.  
3 
Dedicated ETC lane configuration was discussed next. The panel concluded that, as a general 
guideline, it is recommended to keep faster moving traffic to the left of the plaza, consistent with 
typical highway speeds, and to minimize the amount of weaving needed to access plaza lanes. In 
addition, the panel recommended that grouping lanes of similar payment types together is 
preferable. Some panelists noted that the location of the plaza administration building also 
influences the placement of lanes. The recommendation of the panel was to provide a lane 
configuration that minimizes the number of lanes of live traffic that toll plaza workers have to 
cross to reach toll booths, or to service equipment.  
The discussion then turned to how best to provide advance warning to drivers of toll plaza lane 
configuration, what types of payment are accepted, whether the lanes are open or closed, distance 
to the toll plaza, speed restrictions through toll plaza lanes and toll rates. Panelists also noted that 
the information provide to drivers could also include the use of tokens/tickets, and whether ETC 
is accepted in every lane etc. It was noted that some agencies have not installed ETC in every 
lane due to funding limitations. The general recommendation was that it was desirable to provide 
ETC in all lanes.  
Session A: Signing, Pavement Markings and Channelization 
Toll Plaza Sign Placement and Message Content 
The discussion of toll plaza signing began with a general discussion of the factors that should be 
considered. The WSA Team listed the basic elements that influence motorist understanding of 
signing including: visible elements, such as the lane types and plaza; invisible elements, such as 
payment types accepted, toll amounts; and, user elements, such as driver familiarity. The WSA 
Team stressed that the driver population consists of commuters or frequent users of the facility 
who do not need to always read the sign, and tourists or infrequent users, who need significantly 
more information. The WSA Team suggested that there is a need to provide signing for the 
unfamiliar traveler, since even though these drivers represent a small proportion of users, they 
can have a significant impact on toll plaza operation and safety by making last-minute lane 
changes/choices or by stopping in non-stop lanes.  
The MUTCD requirements for Freeway Guide Sign spacing was raised as a possible starting 
point for the discussion of toll plaza advance sign placement. The MUTCD recommends that 
advance guide signing for major/intermediate freeway interchanges be provided at distances of 2, 
1 and ½ mile from the interchange. The advance sign at the 2-mile distance is optional, but 
recommended. For minor interchanges, the MUTCD requires advance signs at 1 and ½ mile 
distances from the interchange. In addition, the MUTCD recommends placing signs overhead 
when three or more mainline lanes exist in one direction, or at complex interchanges.  
One panelist said that Florida provides a minimum spacing of 1000 ft between toll plaza advance 
signs. The discussion then turned to whether it is necessary to provide information on plaza lane 
configuration on all signs in advance of the toll plaza, or whether it is better to separate plaza 
lane configuration signing from toll plaza advance signing. Examples of toll plaza advance 
signing from Florida and Illinois were reviewed to determine the advantages and disadvantages 
of combining advance toll plaza signing with lane configuration signing. Combining lane  
4 
configuration signing with toll plaza advance signing reduces the number of signs needed, and 
reduces sign clutter. However, this results in drivers having to absorb more information from 
each sign. The panel agreed that the first advance toll plaza sign should only provide information 
on the toll plaza ahead. The panel also concluded there was a need to separately address advance 
signing for Express lane toll plazas since signing needs to be provided for the divergence of 
express lanes from the mainline lanes that feed the convent ional toll plaza. The panel discussion 
led to the following signing schemes for Express ETC lane and Conventional toll plazas.  
Table 1 summarizes the panel’s recommended signing scheme for Express lane toll plazas. The 
panel recommended providing toll plaza advance signs at distances of approximately 2, 1 and ½ 
mile from the point at which the Express lanes and mainline lanes feeding the Conventional 
plaza diverge.  
In addition, the panel recommended that the advance sign 2 miles from the divergence point be 
placed overhead. However, this sign could be installed as a ground-mounted sign on the side of 
the road. The 1 and ½ mile signs were recommended to be placed overhead. The distances of 2, 1 
and ½ mile were chosen as desirable locations, although it was recognized that local conditions 
would dictate the specific placement distance of these signs from the divergence point. The panel 
recommended that providing toll rate information on the 2, 1 and ½ mile signs should be 
optional.  
At the gore (i.e. the divergence point of Express and mainline lanes), it was recommended that 
overhead signs be placed that indicate the payment methods accepted in the Express vs. 
Conventional lanes. In addition, vehicle restriction information and lane use signs should be 
provided at the divergence point.  
The panel recommended that, provided sufficient distance exists from the gore to the plaza 
canopy, a sign be placed a minimum of 800 feet from the canopy that provides payment methods 
accepted at various plaza lanes. This distance was selected to ensure that the sign did not obstruct 
plaza canopy signing. The panel also determined that providing lane-speed restrictions could be 
provided as an option on this sign.  
Recommended information to be provided on canopy signing included: payment types accepted 
(ETC, exact coins, tokens, tickets, or change), vehicle restrictions, lane use messages 
(open/closed), and lane-speed restrictions.  
Detailed toll rate information was only recommended to be provided on a toll schedule sign, 
placed close to the plaza. The optional toll rate information on the 2, 1 and ½ mile signs should 
only be provided as brief messages, with detailed toll rate information provided on the separate 
toll schedule sign.  
Table 2 summarizes the panel’s recommended signing scheme for Conventional toll plazas. 
These toll plazas may include dedicated ETC lanes, although these lanes are not fully separated 
from the cash toll lanes. Vehicles using the dedicated ETC lanes approach the plaza together 
with cash-paying vehicles, and merge with the cash traffic after going through the plaza.  
5 
For the Conventional plaza, distances are measured from the plaza canopy. The panel 
recommended providing toll plaza advance signs at distances of approximately 2, 1 and ½ mile 
from the plaza. On the 2 mile sign, the panel recommended including messages warning of the 
toll plaza ahead, with optional toll rate information. Overhead sign placement was preferred, 
although ground-mounted roadside signs could be used instead.  
6 
7 
8 
The recommended placement of the 1 and ½ mile signs is overhead, with sign content composed 
of messages warning of a toll plaza ahead, the payment methods accepted, vehicle restrictions, 
and toll rate information as an option.  
An optional sign was also proposed at a distance of ¼ mile from the plaza canopy that provides 
payment method/lane type information, lane use information (open/closed) and lane-speed 
restrictions. Payment methods/lane type and lane-speed restrictions messages are optional.  
Design of Toll Plaza Signing 
The panel also discussed issues of sign background colors, logos signifying ETC programs, 
diagrammatic signing, symbols and terminology typically used in toll plaza signing.  
Advance signing to warn drivers of a toll plaza ahead varies from agency to agency. Examples 
reviewed by the panel included yellow-background “warning” signs, green “guide” signs, and 
white “regulatory” signs. Linda Brown indicated that guide signing could be used to inform 
drivers of toll plazas. However, the panel indicated that there is a need to distinguish toll plazas 
from interchanges. The majority of the panel recommended that advance signing for toll plazas 
use yellow-background warning signs.  
The panel next discussed background colors for payment types. Some panelists indicated that 
their agency intends to use purple as the background color for ETC dedicated lanes. Linda 
Brown indicated that FHWA favors a white background for toll plaza payment-type signing, 
since customers are required to pay a toll, and the signs serve a “regulatory” purpose. Ms. Brown 
said that the type of lane (ETC/Exact Change/Manual etc.) could be designated by a 
supplemental plaque with a distinct color for each payment type. The panel concluded that 
specific background colors for the various payment types are desirable, although no consensus 
was reached as to what were the best colors. Candidate colors selected included white and purple 
for dedicated ETC lanes, although the panel recommended other colors also be evaluated. Some 
panelists questioned whether logos used on the purple background would be distinguishable 
during low visibility conditions such as dawn and dusk. One panelist suggested that different 
background colors for each payment type would provide better recognition/target value at greater 
distances, rather than using a single color (e.g. white) for all signs. This panelist suggested that 
white be used as the background color for dedicated ETC lane signing, since only drivers who 
are part of the ETC program are permitted to use these lanes, and they are often operated as non-
stop lanes. In other lanes, drivers are typically required to stop and pay a toll, so the panelist 
suggested the signing use background colors different from the ETC lanes. The panel 
unanimously recommended that the red background used by some agencies for manual toll 
collection lanes not be used.  
ETC logos are placed on advance and canopy signing by many agencies. The panel reviewed 
several different applications of ETC logos. In response to panelists’ questions, Ms. Brown 
indicated that FHWA would not require a national ETC logo. Aspects of ETC logos that 
panelists suggested should be addressed included size of the logo and contrast between the logo 
color and sign background. However, FHWA would like to standardize other aspects of toll  
9 
plaza signing, such as symbols used to identify manual and exact-coin toll collection. Ms. Brown 
said that FHWA is currently conducting an evaluation of toll plaza signing and symbols under a 
“Pooled-Fund” study, and that the panel could recommend additional symbols for evaluation. 
Symbols representing “a toll attendants in a booth” and “a hand dropping coins into a basket” 
were recommended by the panelists for the Pooled Fund study.  
Diagrammatic signs used by the Oklahoma Turnpike Authority (OTA) and Orlando-Orange 
County Expressway Authority (OOCEA) to convey the divergence of Express ETC lanes from 
the mainline lanes (Conventional Toll collection) were reviewed. The panel indicated a need to 
standardize diagrammatic signs, although no specific recommendation was provided.  
The panel indicated that the terminology used in toll plaza signing needs to be standardized. 
Examples of terminology used to designate manual toll collection included: Cashier, Full 
Service, Attendant, Change/Receipts, Change, Cash/Receipts, Change Provided, and Manual. 
For exact change toll collection, examples included: Automatic, Exact Change, Exact Coins, and 
Coins Only. Similar examples were also reviewed for ETC toll collection. No consensus was 
reached on the terminology, and the panel concluded that additional evaluation needs to be 
conducted on this issue.  
Pavement Striping and Channelization 
The panel only discussed pavement striping and channelization with respect to guiding drivers 
into the lanes and preventing last-minute lane changing. The panel recommended the use of 
pavement striping and channelization/delineators only for non-stop lanes. The striping extends 
from the plaza for several hundred feet at some agencies to over a ¼ mile at others. The striping 
and channelization recommended is distinct from the “gore area” pavement markings used by 
many agencies to identify toll islands and attenuators.  
Session C: Attenuators and Crash Blocks 
Attenuator and crash block usage at toll agencies were discussed briefly. The variety of designs 
currently used were reviewed, with the following recommendations. Use of the “bull nose” crash 
block design was discouraged due to the potential for directing errant vehicles upward and 
possibly into a toll booth. The panel indicated that the attenuators used should conform to 
NCHRP 350 standards. In addition, the panel discussed what vehicle speed should be assumed 
when designing the attenuators: should the plaza approach speed limit be used, or should the 
mainline speed limit be used? Panelists commented that a drowsy driver may not slow down 
approaching the toll plaza, and the best approach would be to assume the operating speed of the 
mainline. One panelist indicated that Florida assumes a speed of 70 mph, based on the posted 
speed limit on the mainline.  
The panel also discussed the use of two bollards (crash blocks) placed some distance apart 
upstream of toll booths. The reason for having separate bollards is to act as a vehicle trap - if a 
speeding vehicle hits the first and is launched upwards, the space between the bollards acts as a 
vehicle trap, capturing the vehicle before it reaches the toll booth.  
10 
Session D: Manual, ACM/ATIM and ETC Equipment Implementation 
Lane Use Signals, Flashing Beacons, and Transaction Indicators 
Panelists raised the issue of inconsistent usage of lane-use signals and flashers. Examples 
mentioned included the use of yellow flashing beacons next to lane-use signals/signal heads over 
the lanes. These flashing beacons are sometimes used both on the attenuators/crash blocks as 
well over the lane. The panel recommended that standard lane-use signals (MUTCD minimum 
size 18 inches) be used (only green down-arrow and red X), with signal heads as an alternative. 
If signal heads are used to indicate whether the lane is open or closed, the panel recommended 
that 12- inch diameter heads be used, and that only red and green heads be installed (no yellow 
head). The panel recommended that flashing beacons not be installed together with the lane-use 
signal or signal-heads, as it provides contradictory information to drivers. In addition, the panel 
recommended that flashing yellow beacons could be placed on both sides of the canopy sign, or 
over the sign (not below the sign) only for dedicated ETC lanes, but not for other lane types. The 
purpose of the flashing beacon is to draw attention to the lane, but not to serve as a lane-use 
signal.  
The panel recommended that transaction indicator lights not be used in Express ETC lanes, 
although they may be installed in dedicated ETC and cash toll lanes. The panel felt that 
transaction indicator lights may unduly distract drivers in non-stop ETC lanes. However, the 
panel felt that feedback provided to drivers on account balance in non-stop ETC lanes does have 
some value. In exact change and attended lanes, the panel indicated that Red, Amber and Green 
signal heads or pedestrian type displays with messages such as STOP-PAY TOLL/THANK 
YOU may be used.  
The panel also discussed the use of Stop signs in manual and exact change toll collection lanes. 
Examples of modified Stop signs were reviewed (e.g. with supplemental messages on the Stop 
sign such as “Pay Toll” and “Get Ticket”). Some panelists indicated that the limited space to 
place signing on the islands had necessitated placing the supplemental messages on the Stop 
signs. No consensus recommendation on the use of the modified Stop signs was provided. 
However, the panel indicated that a new section of the MUTCD could specify a modified Stop 
sign that included supplemental messages such as “Pay Toll” or “Get Ticket”. This new sign 
would be restricted for use only at toll plazas. The panel also discussed one agency’s practice of 
using a rectangular sign with the message “Stop/Pay Toll” using black letters on a white 
background. The panel recommended against using this sign.  
WORKSHOP CONCLUSION AND NEXT STEPS 
The preceding summarizes the discussions and recommendations of the Expert Panel on specific 
issues. The WSA Team indicated that a summary of the workshop would be provided to all 
participants for review and comment. Subsequently, a report on the state-of-the-practice and 
design guidelines will be prepared and distributed to toll agencies for review and comment.

APPENDIX C 
LITERATURE REVIEW 
Vollmer Associates LLP. E-Z Pass Evaluation Report. August 2000. 
Keywords: safety, signage 
Methodology: 
Vollmer Associates LLP was retained by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to 
evaluate the success of the E-Z Pass implementation program on the New York State 
Thruway.  This study reviewed short and long term policy goals and the anticipated costs 
and benefits of the E-Z Pass implementation program.  An analysis of the changes in 
traffic volumes, travel patterns, frequency of trips and the total number of accidents were 
conducted at five tolled locations on the New York State Thruway and the actual results 
were compared with the anticipated results associated with the E-Z Pass implementation 
process. 
The five analysis locations selected included the Tappan Zee Bridge and Buffalo City 
mainline barrier toll plazas and Interchanges 16 (Harriman), 24 (Albany) and 49 (Depew) 
tolled ramps on the controlled system. 
In addition, an analysis was conducted to determine the success of the signage regarding 
the E-Z Pass system on the Thruway.  This analysis primarily consisted of discussions with 
Thruway personnel, violation rates and anecdotal data from Thruway users. 
Results: 
According to the accident data from 1992 through 1998 obtained from the New York 
State Thruway, out of the total number of accidents at each of the five locations the 
percentage of E-Z Pass related accidents increased at each location analyzed.  However, 
the increase at each location was lower than the increase in overall E-Z Pass usage at those 
locations.  In general, the number of accidents per 1,000,000 transactions decreased at 
most locations, suggesting that E-Z Pass implementation did not result in an increase of 
total accidents. 
As far as signage is concerned, there is a general consensus that the E-Z Pass signage is 
clear and easily understood.  According to the New York State Thruway Authority 
(NYSTA), the violation rate in 2000 was just over one percent for E-Z Pass lanes 
compared to the five to ten percent rate for all other toll facilities.

on Traffic Control Strategies at Toll Plazas 
Initially, two alternatives to E-Z Pass signing were reviewed.  One option involved the 
installation of variable message signs on top of the toll plaza canopy and in advance of the 
toll plaza.  The second alternative involved the installation of Manual of Uniform Traffic 
Control Devices (MUTCD) approved signs that were color coded and contained logos 
specific to the payment options available when entering the toll plaza.  Although different 
in color and logo, each of the signs was uniform in size.  The latter alternative was 
ultimately selected. 
Drivers generally encounter signs approximately one to 1 ½ miles from the toll plaza.  The 
group of signs indicates the type and location of the payment lanes.  For most of the 
barrier plazas on the Thruway, the configuration is such that the signs read: Exact Change 
Only – Left Lanes, E-Z Pass No Cash 5 MPH – Center Lanes, and Cash Receipts – Left 
Lanes. 
The second group of signs are encountered approximately ½ mile to ⅓ mile after the first 
group.  These signs provide information on the price of and the distance to the toll.  For 
example, a sign would read: Tollbooths ½ Mile – 40¢.  Within the last ½ mile of the toll 
plaza, individual message signs are installed on the roadside indicating the location of each 
lane payment type.  Variable message signs on the toll plaza canopy indicate whether the 
lanes are opened or closed and in which direction the traffic is flowing (for reversible lanes 
only). 
In addition to the signage, flashing yellow lights have been installed above the E-Z Pass 
lanes which have further reduced weaving and violations.  It should be noted that studies at 
the Spring Valley toll barrier indicated user confusion long after E-Z Pass was fully 
operational.

from Adding Express Toll Lanes at a Mainline Toll Plaza. Transportation Research 
Board 83rd Annual Meeting. November 2003. 
Keywords: toll plaza operations 
Methodology: 
Data were collected at the University Mainline Toll Plaza on the Orlando-Orange County 
Expressway system prior to and after the addition of two ETC express lanes in each 
direction to determine the reduction in the level of delay at the plaza. 
Prior to the plaza expansion there were a total of eight lanes with the two center lanes 
being reversible.  Generally, five lanes were kept open in the direction of the peak period, 
leaving three available lanes in the opposite direction.  While all lanes accepted ETC 
payment, the configuration in the peak direction usually consisted of two manual lanes, one 
automatic lane and two dedicated ETC lanes.

State of the Practice and Recommendations 
on Traffic Control Strategies at Toll Plazas 
After the plaza expansion, none of the lanes were designated as reversible.  Rather, there 
are six lanes in each direction consisting of two manual lanes, two automatic lanes and two 
dedicated express ETC lanes.  The dedicated ETC lane speed limit was raised from 35 mph 
to 55 mph. 
Cameras were mounted at various locations at and near the plaza to capture traffic 
upstream and downstream of the plaza.  Roughly 30 hours of “typical” week day peak hour 
footage was recorded prior to and after the expansion of the plaza for a total of 60 hours.  
In addition, transaction data was obtained through detailed audit (DA) reports to evaluate 
lane throughput, speed, vehicle classification and the ETC participation rate. 
The data collected was analyzed to compare measures of effectiveness prior to and after 
plaza expansion.  The measures of effectiveness evaluated were throughput, vehicular delay 
(difference between plaza arrival and departure time), queue length, service time (time 
spent paying toll) and inter-vehicle time. 
Results: 
Overall throughput, measured in vehicles/hour (vph), increased slightly in the southbound 
direction and significantly in the northbound direction.  This was due to a combination of 
increased speeds in the dedicated ETC express lanes as well as a decrease in ETC payment 
in the conventional lanes. 
As a result of the plaza expansion, vehicular delay went from an average of 12 seconds in 
the automatic lanes and 15 seconds in the manual lanes to an average of six and eight 
seconds respectively.  There were no delays in the ETC lanes. 
The queue lengths were measured in vehicles/minute (veh/min).  Prior to the plaza 
improvements, the average maximum queue observed in the automatic lane was nine veh/
min and five veh/min in the manual lanes, regardless of direction.  After plaza 
improvements the average maximum queue was three veh/min for both automatic and 
manual lanes.  The average service time remained virtually unchanged in the conventional 
lanes from prior to and after the plaza improvements. 
The inter-vehicle time is the difference between two consecutive vehicular departure times 
at the toll plaza at a specific lane.  An overall average inter-vehicle time was derived by 
calculating the mean of all lanes for each lane type.  The average inter-vehicle time for the 
ETC lanes was reduced by almost 50 percent as a result of the plaza improvements.

Considerations in Designing Electronic Toll Plazas: Case Study. ITE Journal. 
March 2001. 
Keywords: toll plaza operations, safety 
Methodology: 
This study investigates the potential safety concerns occurring around toll plazas, with 
particular regard to varying payment methods and AVI technology.  The Holland-East 
mainline toll plaza on the Orlando-Orange County Expressway Authority (OOCEA) 
system in Florida was chosen as the focus of the analysis due to the high number of toll 
transactions that occur there.  At the time of the investigation, the plaza consisted of 14 
lanes, five stationary lanes in each direction and four reversible center lanes.  Analysis of 
the Holland-East Plaza occurred under the following four stages of development. 
• Stage 1: Conventional lanes. 
• Stage 2: Mixed AVI lanes (no dedicated lanes) and the introduction of E-PASS 
accounting for 15 percent of transactions. 
• Stage 3: Single dedicated AVI lane (per direction) and a 28 percent E-PASS 
transaction rate. 
• Stage 4: Two dedicated AVI lanes (per direction) and a 34 percent E-PASS 
transaction rate. 
Three-and-a-half years of crash statistics compiled by the OOCEA were reviewed and 
categorized into four classification types: merging and sideswipe collisions, queuing and 
rear-end collisions, speeding and hit-plaza collisions and pedestrian related accidents.  In 
addition, potential conflict points were evaluated on the approach to the Holland-East 
Plaza.  The identification of potential conflict points was based on several factors 
including the toll lane type, vehicle deceleration rates, final velocity, the number of toll 
lanes and the volume of cross traffic between the lanes.  This identification process was 
based on a similar study done at the Holland Tunnel in New Jersey. 
Results: 
Between January 1994 and June 1997, roughly 32 percent of crashes on the OOCEA 
system occurred at the 10 mainline toll plazas, 46 percent occurred at the ramps and 22 
percent on the mainline sections between plazas and ramps.  The average monthly crash 
rate prior to E-PASS (ETC) implementation was roughly 3.5 crashes/month as opposed 
to 7.5 crashes/month one year after E-PASS implementation.  Ten percent of the total 
crashes were related to the E-PASS system because they either involved an E-PASS 
vehicle or occurred in a dedicated E-PASS lane.

State of the Practice and Recommendations 
on Traffic Control Strategies at Toll Plazas 
Out of the 10 mainline toll plazas, the Holland-East plaza has the highest percentage of 
crashes at roughly 70 percent.  The crashes at this plaza account for over 21 percent of all 
crashes on the OOCEA system.  The conflict points that were identified on the approach 
to this plaza specifically addressed merging, queuing and speeding vehicles. 
Merging and sideswipe collisions increased during Stage 3 as a result of the introduction of 
a new toll payment method (dedicated E-PASS lane).  This was due to increased weaving 
and merging as a result of an additional choice in lane type.  However, as drivers became 
more familiar with the lane configuration of the plaza, merging and sideswipe collisions 
decreased during Stage 4. 
An increase in rear-end collisions also occurred during Stage 3, though queuing decreased.  
This was primarily attributed to driver confusion as many users stopped in the middle of 
the dedicated E-PASS lane after realizing that the toll could not be paid through 
conventional payment methods.  Rear-end collisions remained high even at the beginning 
of Stage 4.  This was most likely due to the relative unfamiliarity of the E-PASS system in 
addition to a second dedicated lane. 
Crash severity increased during Stages 3 and 4 as a result of higher speeds through the 
plaza.  The estimated property damage rate was used to represent crash severity.  The 
estimated property damage rate increase is directly related to the implementation of the 
dedicated E-PASS lanes, as vehicles do not have to stop when passing through the plaza.  
Hit-plaza (structure) collisions increased as well.  This was primarily attributed to drivers 
misjudging the lane with of the dedicated lanes at higher speeds. 
Though crashes involving pedestrians were not reported, the potential for risk is higher 
with AVI technology.  Since E-PASS vehicles using the dedicated lanes are not required to 
stop at the plaza, plaza employees or any other pedestrians who exit their vehicles for 
whatever reason are at greater risk of being hit. 
Recommendations: 
It is recommended that the dedicated E-PASS lanes be moved to the far left of the plaza as 
opposed to the center of the plaza.  This may reduce the number of sideswipe collisions.  
Since faster drivers typically stay to the left lanes, it is logical to locate dedicated ETC lanes 
which do not require drivers to stop to the left.  In addition, non-E-PASS users would 
know that there are no lanes to the left of the dedicated lanes and would only have a choice 
to go to the right. 
Another suggestion would be to provide a more gradual and longer diverge area on the 
approach to the plaza.  If drivers diverge from three or four lanes to five or six onto a total 
of nine, it would provide a smoother transition through the approach. 
Advance signing is another useful tool to inform drivers of which lane to use for what

specific toll payment method.  Variable message signs (VMS) mounted in advance of the 
plaza as well as on the plaza canopy could provide more organization in identifying 
payment methods, lane status (open/closed) and even expected delay.  Pavement markings 
could also help to channel drivers, eliminating much of the weaving that occurs. 
 
Wilbur Smith Associates. Toll Plaza Safety Study: Plaza 51, York Road East-West 
Tollway. November 1999. 
Keywords: safety, toll plaza operations 
Methodology: 
Wilbur Smith Associates (WSA) examined the lane configuration of a “typical” toll plaza on 
the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority (ISTHA) system in order to determine the 
impacts on safety anticipated as ISTHA’s  I-PASS program expands.  Plaza 51, York Road, 
on the East-West Tollway was selected for the study location.  At the time of the study 
Plaza 51 consisted of 20 lanes, nine in the eastbound direction (four manual, four 
automatic and one I-PASS) and 11 in the westbound direction (six manual, four automatic 
and one I-PASS). 
The traffic volume in each toll lane and the vehicle class was recorded in five minute 
increments during “shoulder peak” hours of operation.  In addition, average approach 
speeds at the plaza and lane changes were recorded as well.  The observed data was then 
used in WSAs TOLLSIM model to calibrate existing plaza operations and to estimate plaza 
queuing and toll lane usage under two separate scenarios.  One scenario simulated the 
existing conditions and the other evaluated 1998 conditions which assumed no I-PASS 
only lanes and an eight percent I-PASS participation rate.  Finally, the original data and 
outputs from the TOLLSIM model were used as inputs into WSAs safety model, 
SAFESIM, to estimate the probability of conflict points directly related to accidents. 
Data collected during the shoulder peak hours (10:00 AM – 12:00 PM and 1:00 PM – 3:00 
PM) were used because most accidents occur during these periods.  During the off-peak, 
traffic is light and the probability of a conflict occurring is low.  During peak hours, lane 
changes are rare and occur at slow speeds because queues from the toll plaza extend back 
into the mainline upstream of the taper. 
Results: 
When compared to the 1998 pre-I-PASS conditions, the results of the analysis indicate that 
there is a 13 percent reduction in the probability of a conflict in the eastbound direction 
and an 11 percent reduction in the westbound direction with the implementation of an I-
PASS only lane and increased I-PASS participation.  The overall probability of conflict in 
either direction is higher on the departure side of the plaza than on the approach side.  This 
  
 8 
  
State of the Practice and Recommendations 
on Traffic Control Strategies at Toll Plazas 
is due to the fact that there are more lanes on the approach side than the departure side.  
As was estimated, the probability of conflict was highest during the shoulder peak hours. 
Recommendations: 
The following recommendations were made to further enhance safety in operations at 
Plaza 51: 
Provide adequate signage prior to the entrance to the toll plaza to inform drivers in 
advance of exits immediately downstream of the plaza; 
Investigate the possibility of providing a second I-PASS only lane in the center of the toll 
plaza; 
Reconfigure the toll plaza to reduce sideswipe collisions; and 
Provide a barrier on the I-PASS lane to prohibit drivers from making a lane change at the 
toll plaza into the conventional lanes.  In addition, adequate warning signs should be posted 
in advance for drivers entering the plaza.

and Logit Models for Traffic Safety Analysis of Toll Plazas. Transportation 
Research Record 1784: Paper No. 02-2270.  
Keywords: toll plaza operations, safety 
Methodology: 
This study examines two different modeling approaches in determining measures of safety 
at toll plazas.  One of the models is statistics-based while the other is an artificial neural 
network (ANN).  ANNs can be further categorized into two architectures: Multi-Layer 
Perception (MLP) and Radial Basis Functions (RBF). 
Accident reports from 1999 and 2000 for the Central Florida expressway system were used 
to construct a database for the analysis.  The Central Florida expressway system consists of 
three state roads: SR 408, SR 417 and SR 528.  The entire network contains 79 miles of 
roadway, 10 mainline toll plazas and 42 ramp plazas.  Out of the 1,932 accidents that 
occurred for the combined years of 1999 and 2000, 23 percent occurred in the vicinity of a 
toll plaza. 
After screening out the incomplete reports, a database of 725 vehicles (drivers) was created.  
Of those 725 vehicles, 43.6 percent were involved in an accident while approaching the 
plaza, 43.7 percent were involved in an accident at the plaza and 12.7 percent were involved 
in an accident while leaving the plaza.

State of the Practice and Recommendations 
on Traffic Control Strategies at Toll Plazas 
The accidents were further categorized by a variety of measures including driver age, 
gender, license type, alcohol involvement, violation and whether or not the driver was an 
E-PASS user; vehicle type, point of impact, number of impacts and speed ratio (estimated 
running speed to posted speed limit); and the type of toll plaza (mainline or ramp) and road 
conditions/environmental factors. 
Results: 
The study revealed that a two-level nested logit model was the most suitable model for 
identifying probabilities of an accident location.  The model elasticity values showed that 
plaza type, peak period, vehicle type and E-PASS use have the greatest affect on the 
likelihood of an accident occurring upstream, at or downstream of a toll plaza.  E-PASS 
users have an 11 percent increase in the probability of being involved in an accident at the 
toll plaza. 
The RFB neural network was the best model for analyzing driver injury severity.  The 
results showed that older drivers have a higher risk of being injured in accidents than 
younger drivers and that female drivers have a greater chance of severe injury than male 
drivers.  Overall, E-PASS users have the highest risk of being injured in an accident.  
Drivers in passenger cars are more likely to experience severe injuries than drivers of 
trucks. 
Recommendations: 
Based on the model results, the following recommendations suggest: 
• Improvement is needed in lane markings on the approach to toll plazas. 
• Traffic signs should be provided to alert drivers not to stop in ETC lanes under any 
circumstances. 
• The width of ETC lanes should be large enough to accommodate heavy trucks 
equipped with an ETC transponder. 
• The approach zone at a toll plaza should be just as illuminated as the plaza structure.

This paper examines the Generic Toll Plaza Simulation (GENTOPS) model as it relates to

State of the Practice and Recommendations

toll plaza operation and safety considerations.  GENTOPS differs from other toll plaza 
simulation models in that it models free flow or “unchannelized” vehicle movements 
within the transition zones of the toll plaza while considering the surrounding highway 
network as well.  GENTOPS was designed to be integrated with the WATSim highway 
microsimulation model so that regional networks containing multiple toll plazas could be 
analyzed. 
GENTOPS assigns vehicles to booths using a “Utility Score” to identify the most attractive 
booth for each vehicle at the current time.  A toll booth is identified as a potential 
candidate if it services the vehicle type and selected toll payment, is accessible from the 
vehicle’s plaza approach link and is compatible with the vehicle’s plaza exit link. 
GENTOPS also provides several statistics that can be viewed as potential safety measures 
of effectiveness.  One of these measures is the “Percent of Vehicle Movements that 
Exceed a Specified Heading.”  This is a measure of lateral movement within the reception 
and departure areas of the toll plaza.  Though there is no empirical evidence to support the 
theory, it is often argued that pronounced lateral movement increases the exposure of 
vehicles to side-swipe collisions.  As a result, toll plaza managers frequently erect internal 
barriers to restrict lateral movements in the interest of safety. 
A simulation of the Newburgh-Beacon Bridge toll plaza in New York State was conducted 
using the GENTOPS model.  The model was calibrated based on inputs obtained from the 
NYS Bridge Authority to develop a base scenario.  Once the base scenario was established, 
analyses of alternative toll both configurations were conducted to determine whether the 
existing configuration was optimal or could be improved.  In addition, scenarios were 
evaluated in which there was an 80 percent E-Z Pass participation rate as opposed to the 
60 percent rate at the time of analysis.  Overall, nine alternatives were examined. 
Results: 
Based upon the model outputs, it was determined that the existing plaza configuration 
consisting of two E-Z Pass only lanes and six mixed use lanes (E-Z Pass and cash) under 
the current E-Z Pass participation rate at the time provided for the optimal operating 
conditions at the Newburgh-Beacon Bridge toll plaza.  Likewise, the percentages of 
vehicles with pronounced lateral movement was much lower than in the other alternatives 
examined. 
At the 80 percent E-Z Pass participation rate, an alternative scenario in which a 
configuration of three cash only lanes and four E-Z Pass only lanes provided for an 
improvement in operating conditions and safety measures over the original configuration.

Keywords: toll plaza simulation, delay 
Methodology: 
This paper examines an analytical delay model that can be used as an alternative to more 
complex toll plaza simulation models for the purpose of expediting the toll plaza planning 
process.  The Institute of Transportation, Ministry of Transportation and Communications 
in Taiwan sponsored the development of a stochastic, microscopic simulation model, 
referred to as the toll plaza simulation (TPS) model, to calibrate and test the delay model 
presented in this paper.  The delay model estimates total delay by accounting for extra 
travel time due to deceleration, toll paying, acceleration and time spent waiting in queue.  
The model is calibrated with simulation data and, for V/C ratios less than 1.4, can yield 
delay estimates within 10 percent of simulated values. 
Recommendations: 
It is recommended that the delay model be used for preliminary screening of alternative 
designs and operations.  However, further investigation should be conducted to determine 
if the model can adequately estimate delay based upon field data.

Evaluation of Traffic Operations at Electronic Toll Collection Plazas. 
Transportation Research Record 1710: Paper No. 00-1519. 
Keywords: traffic simulation, toll plaza operation, delay 
Methodology: 
The Transportation Systems Institute at the University of Central Florida developed a toll 
plaza simulation model (TPSIM).  TPSIM is a stochastic object-oriented discrete-event 
microscopic simulation model.  The model consists of three main modules.  These modules 
are the data entry interface which allows for inputs representing the plaza geometry, traffic 
and toll lane characteristics, global parameters (speed, driver reaction time, etc.) and run 
specifications; the simulation logic and algorithms; and the model output consisting of 
measures of effectiveness such as throughput, queue length, delay and lane utilization. 
The model was verified by eliminating any flaws through debugging and minor 
modifications.  The model was also validated by comparing the outputs of a simulation of 
the Holland-East mainline toll plaza on the Orlando-Orange County Expressway to real-
world observations.  Data collection of the toll plaza was achieved by utilizing video 
  
 12 
  
State of the Practice and Recommendations 
on Traffic Control Strategies at Toll Plazas 
cameras to capture queuing delay, service time, queue length and throughput.  In addition, 
a distance-measuring instrument (DMI) was installed on five different vehicles that passed 
through the plaza during the morning peak hour.  Specifically, the DMIs were used to 
measure each of the vehicles’ approach speed and desired acceleration and deceleration 
rates within the toll plaza area.  A total of 35 runs were made (5 morning peak runs for 7 
days) during the data collection process.  In addition, 20 TPSIM simulations were run with 
different random number streams and the results were averaged for each 5-minute interval 
within the simulated hour.  Comparisons between the model outputs and the plaza 
observations were made by examining throughput, average queuing delay and total queuing 
delay. 
Finally, several simulation scenarios were conducted to investigate the impact of electronic 
toll collection (ETC) market penetration on the benefits of ETC technology.  The base 
scenario was modified by increasing or decreasing E-PASS market penetration in 
increments of 10 percent.  To accommodate the increase in the volume of E-PASS 
vehicles, additional dedicated E-PASS lanes were introduced to the left of the two existing 
E-PASS lanes in the base scenario.  Throughout the analysis, the proportion of automatic 
payment vehicles remained fixed at 20 percent.  The introduction of a new dedicated E-
PASS lane was achieved by converting one of the existing manual payment lanes into an E-
PASS lane. 
Results: 
The findings of this analysis indicate that the benefits of E-PASS operation are sensitive to 
the plaza configuration.  Adding more E-PASS lanes without an increase in E-PASS 
participation could cause an increase in total plaza queuing delay.  However, regardless of 
the plaza configuration, total plaza delay can be reduced by 50 percent if 10 percent of the 
vehicles switch from the manual payment lanes to E-PASS lanes. 
Recommendations: 
In addition to the applications examined in this analysis, it is suggested that the TPSIM 
model also be use to determine the optimal configuration in toll plaza design, tollbooth 
scheduling and in finding the best lane arrangement to increase plaza efficiency during off-
peak hours.

The intent of this research was to present a set of proposed design standards for toll 
facilities in the absence of any official design guidelines.  This analysis expanded upon 
earlier efforts to develop toll plaza design standards by examining the increasing use of 
electronic toll collection (ETC) facilities.  The authors of this paper gathered input from 
toll agencies and consulting firms from 14 states and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. 
The authors reviewed several elements of toll plaza design such as: pavement markings, 
lane channelization, plaza island extensions, word and symbol markings and signage.  After 
comparing the design plans obtained from the different agencies/consultants with the 
Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), design guidelines were created for 
toll facility pavement markings and signs.  These guidelines were presented to the panel of 
toll experts for review and comment, and recommendations were made based upon the 
responses. 
Results: 
Of the three methods of lane channelization presented to the panel, full channelization was 
preferred.  Full channelization consists of pavement markings (striping) through the 
approach to each individual lane at the toll plaza.  The panel recommended the addition of 
reflective pavement markers as well.  With the exception of reversible lanes (which are 
yellow in color), all line colors should be white.  The panel also recommended that solid 
white lines be used to designate dedicated or express ETC lanes in order to minimize the 
number of lane changes at these areas. 
There was little consistency among the toll agency design plans regarding toll plaza island 
extensions.  The majority of the panel agreed with the suggested island extension design 
guidelines developed by the researchers.  The design recommended a minimum approach 
length of a 50 foot striped gore with an additional 0 to 25 foot solid line extending from 
the “V” at ramp plazas and a minimum of a 100 foot striped gore with an additional 25 to 
100 foot solid line at mainline plazas.  On the departure the gore would be 50 ft and 100 ft 
at ramps and mainline respectively.  All striping would be in white unless it was for a 
reversible lane. 
An overwhelming majority of the panel were against the use of pavement word markings in 
toll plazas.  The panel did not reach a consensus on any of the proposed symbols or ETC 
names presented by the researchers.  One of the panel experts suggested that an official 
color of ETC be established.  As far as signs are concerned, the MUTCD states symbols 
are more advantageous than words.  However, public education would be required for any 
national toll symbol.  It was agreed upon that when using text, the message should be brief 
and the lettering should be legible.

The intent of this research was to present a set of proposed design standards for toll 
facilities in the absence of any official design guidelines.  This analysis expanded upon 
earlier efforts to develop toll plaza design standards by examining the increasing use of 
electronic toll collection (ETC) facilities.  The authors of this paper gathered input from 
toll agencies and consulting firms from 14 states and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. 
The authors reviewed several elements of toll plaza design such as: lane configurations, 
queue area, taper rates, transition lengths, lane widths and vertical geometrics.  After 
comparing the design plans obtained from the different agencies/consultants with the 
Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), design guidelines were created 
specific to toll facilities.  These guidelines were presented to the panel of toll experts for 
review and comment, and recommendations were made based upon the responses. 
Results: 
After surveying several toll agencies, it was found that ETC express lanes are generally 
implemented in sets of two lanes, side-by-side and in the same direction, and operate at 
speeds in excess of 60 mph.  In the case of dedicated ETC lanes, one or more are typically 
implemented in each direction of travel and are assigned speed limits that range between 15 
to 45 mph.  All ETC lanes are generally separated from the conventional lanes by some 
form of concrete barrier.  A majority of toll professionals recommended a lane 
configuration of express or dedicated ETC lanes on the left, automatic coin machine and 
ticket lanes in the middle and manual lanes on the right; with the ability to pay by ETC in 
all lanes. 
Allowing for express traffic on the left is more difficult when there are reversible lanes 
present.  Based on the panel’s response to several proposals, the following guidelines were 
recommended for plazas with reversible lanes. 
• Consider the prohibition of express or dedicated lanes. 
• Consider reduced speeds for dedicated lanes. 
• Avoid design with high-speed lanes on the right (to ensure uniformity and consistency 
throughout all plazas). 
• If high-speed lanes are required, ensure that the directional peak traffic splits support 
  
 15

on Traffic Control Strategies at Toll Plazas 
their use, that they are barrier separated with adequate identification and that toll 
collection is exclusively electronic. 
There are two methods of design for establishing the length of the queue area.  One 
method is to allow queued vehicles to “stack up” in the approach taper.  The other method 
is to design the queue area to accommodate the entire queue and use the approach taper 
for any overflow when design traffic volumes are exceeded.  The majority of panel 
members agreed upon a method of a manual lane requirement calculation, lane number 
adjustment and validation via a simulation model for determining the minimal queue area. 
A proposed set of toll plaza approach taper rates for conventional lanes were created by 
modifying taper equations published in the 1993 Revision to the MUTCD.  A majority of 
the members of the panel agreed with the recommendations.  Two modifications were 
suggested for the proposed approach taper rates.  One modification would allow for 
reduced taper rates at higher speeds due to physical project constraints, such as a lack of 
sufficient right of way.  The other modification was to establish a minimum taper rate of 
10:1 for all speeds ≤ 30 mph. 
A set of departure (merge) taper rates were also proposed for vehicles exiting the toll plaza.  
These proposed rates were met with a 90 percent approval rate by the panel.  For areas 
where vehicles are not anticipated to stop (express/dedicated lanes), it was recommended 
that equations presented in the 2000 MUTCD and the “Green Book” (A Policy on 
Geometric Design of Highways and Streets) be used for lane additions or subtractions. 
Proposed design standards regarding lane widths, pavement cross slopes, profile grades and 
sight distance for the different lane payment types were developed from a variety of design 
guide publications such as the MUTCD and the Green Book.  The panel responded to 
these recommendations with mixed opinions, but the majority agreed with the proposed
